The book of the generation.—Thus it is verbally in the Greek, Latin, Syrian, Arabic, Egyptian,
Persian texts. But the Ethiopian has <i>the genealogy of Jesus Christ</i>. Matthew here seems to
imitate Moses. Listen to what blessed Peter Damian says in his Sermon on S. Matthew:
<blockquote>
	As Moses is not improperly placed before the prophets and all who have written anything in the Old
	Testament, so Matthew rightly takes precedence of all who are found to have written in the New
	Testament. For as Moses compiled an account of the origin of the world, so has Matthew described
	the rising newness of the Church, as it were of a spiritual world. Hence it has been provided
	that, the <b>Holy Ghost</b> guiding the pen, both Moses and S. Matthew placed the same commencement to
	their respective works, saying, “The Book of the Generation.”
</blockquote>
So far Damian. Now Moses, in <a href="/Genesis:1:1-lapide">Gen. v. 1</a>, thus begins the account of
the genealogy and race of Adam, the first formed man— <i>The Book of generation of Adam</i>: for
Adam was a type of Christ. For as Adam was the father of the mortal life of all men, so is Christ
the Father of the immortal life of the faithful, as S. Paul teaches,
<a href="/Romans:1:14-lapide">Rom. v. 14</a>, &amp;c., and
<a href="/1_Corinthians:15:47-lapide">1 Cor. xv. 47</a> et seq. The Hebrew is תולדות&nbsp; ספר
<i>sepher toledoth, i.e</i>., the book, or catalogue, and enumeration of the generations of Adam.
For, in the <a href="/Genesis:5:1-lapide">5th of Genesis</a>, many, indeed all the generations are
given by which the human race was propagated from Adam to Noah and the Flood, whence it is probable
that S. Matthew, who alludes to Moses, wrote likewise in Hebrew, in this passage,
<i>sepher toledoth, i.e</i>., the book of the generations, in the plural. The LXX, however, in
<a href="/Genesis:5:1-lapide">Gen. v.</a>, have translated <i>βίβλος γενέσεως</i>,
<i>the Book of the generation</i>, in the singular, because the generation of Adam was one, by which
he, as it were the patriarch of the whole human race, begat Seth, which generation was afterwards
continued by Seth and his posterity, and was propagated as far as Noah. The Greek interpreter of S.
Matthew, and the Latin Vulgate, which was translated from the Greek, here followed the LXX, because
properly there is related the generation of Christ alone, whose origin indeed is derived from
Abraham, through many generations of forefathers, and is brought down to Christ. As, therefore, Adam
was the beginning or origin of the old world, so is Christ of the new and better world, whence he is
called by <a href="/Isaiah:9:6-lapide">Isaiah (ix. 6)</a>, “The Father of the coming age.”
(Vulgate). Hence also Virgil, following the Cumæan Sibyl, sings thus concerning Him, Eclogue iv.:—
<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	Now the last age of Cumæan Verses is come,<br />
	Afresh the great cycle of ages begins;<br />
	Returneth the Virgin, Saturnian Kingdoms return:<br />
	The heavenly Offspring descends from on high:
</blockquote>
and adds:—<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	Dear increase of God, true Offspring of Jove,<br />
	Begin, Boy, by smiles thy Mother to know.
</blockquote>
It is plain that these things were spoken by the Sibyl concerning Christ; but Virgil, either through
ignorance or flattery, has transferred them to Pollio, the son of Asinius Pollio, the Roman
Consul.<br /><br />
Note, 1st, <i>Book</i> here is the same as catalogue, or enumeration, or description, whence the
Syriac translation, כתכא, <i>ketobo, i.e</i>., a description, or writing. For this is the exact
meaning of the Hebrew, <i>sepher</i>, to which the Greek <i>βίβλος</i> and Latin
<i>liber</i> correspond. In a like sense, the paper in which was recorded the putting away of a wife
by her husband was called a <i>Book of divorcement</i>. So the <i>Book of the righteous </i>is the
catalogue in which the names and acts of the righteous are recorded. <i>The Book of Life </i>is the
catalogue of the elect, who are written in the mind of God as in a book. Cicero called a catalogue
of names, <i>a book of names</i>.<br /><br />Note, 2nd, the word <i>generation</i>. First, and most
evidently, it is the same as the race, or genealogy of Christ. Second, the generation of Christ is
the conception and birth of Christ. See <a href="/Matthew:1:18-lapide">ver. 18</a>.
<i>The birth </i>(<i>γέννησις</i>) <i>of Jesus Christ was on this wise</i>. Third, as Maldonatus
observes, “the generation of Christ is the life of Christ.” For Matthew, in the Gospel, relates the
history of the whole course of the life of Christ. Fourth, the Hebrew <i>toledoth</i> properly
signifies generations, many of which intervened between Adam and Christ. The steps in Jacob’s
ladder, above which God stood, represented these generations—those steps, I mean, by which the
angels ascended from earth to heaven. For as this ladder joined, as it were, earth to heaven, and
Jacob to God, so this series of generations united all the patriarchs to Christ, who was made Flesh,
and so united all men to Himself and to God.<br /><br />
<i>Son of David, i.e</i>., descendant of David: for the Hebrews call all male lineal descendants,
sons. The Evangelist places David first, then Abraham: 1st, because David was the nearer to Christ,
and through him Christ reaches to Abraham; 2nd, because thus, in a more compendious manner, without
repetition, Christ’s genealogy is stated. He wished to impress this fact, that Christ was descended
from Abraham through David. So S. Jerome. 3rd, and chiefly, because the promise of God made to David
concerning Christ, as about to be born of his posterity, was the later, more special, and more
glorious promise, as S. Chrysostom, Theophilus, Euthym., teach. Hence the Jews constantly call their
Messiah the Son of David. Hence on Palm Sunday, when Christ entered into Jerusalem, they hailed Him
as Messiah: <i>Hosanna to the Son of David, i.e</i>., O Lord, save our Messiah, speaking of Him as
David’s son and heir. Lastly, by the title, <i>Son of David</i>, the nobility of the race from
whence Messiah sprung is hinted at, as also His kingdom, viz., that He too should be a king, as
being the Son of David, a king, according to that divine voice of the Archangel Gabriel to the
Blessed Virgin, “He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God
shall give unto him the throne of David his father: and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for
ever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.” (S. Luke i. 31.) For this reason the prophets
everywhere speak of Christ as David’s son and heir, thus <a href="/Isaiah:9:7-lapide">Is. ix. 7</a>,
<a href="/Leviticus:3:1-lapide">lv. 3</a>; <a href="/Jeremiah:25:5-lapide">Jer. xxv. 5</a>;
<a href="/Ezra:34:23-lapide">Ez. xxxiv. 23</a>, <a href="/Ezra:37:25-lapide">xxxvii. 25</a>,
&amp;c.<br /><br />The first promise which was made to David concerning Christ, that He should
spring from him, and reign for ever, is found <a href="/2_Samuel:7:12-lapide">2 Sam. vii. 12</a>; the
same was confirmed, <a href="/Psalms:88:1-lapide">Ps. lxxxviii</a>. and
<a href="/Psalms:131:1-lapide">cxxxi.</a>; and repeated to Solomon, David’s Son,
<a href="/1_Kings:9:5-lapide">1 Kings ix. 5</a>. When, therefore, S. Matthew says,
<i>Jesus Christ the Son of David</i>, he means that all these promises were now fulfilled in Christ.
Thus S. Chrysostom 2; Theophilus, Euthym.; Irenæus, lib. 8, c. 8; S. Ambrose, lib. 3 <i>in Luc</i>.,
c. 3; and others.<br /><br />
<i>Son of Abraham</i>. The word Son here may be referred either to David or to Christ. For David, as
well as Christ, was a son, <i>i.e</i>. a descendant, of Abraham. It signifies, therefore, that
Christ, through David His father, was also the Son of Abraham, who was the father of them that
believe, and of the ancient Church. The first express promise concerning Christ was made to him.
(Gen. xxii. 18.) Now, from the birth of Abraham to the birth of Christ there were 2,000 years; from
the death of David to Christ, 1,013 years. So great was the antiquity of the oracles and promises of
God concerning Christ; so constant and sure was God’s faithfulness in fulfilling them. And this is
why S. Matthew so carefully derives the genealogy of Christ from Abraham, even through forty-two
generations, in order that he might show the Jews that Jesus Christ was the true Messiah promised to
Abraham, and that He was the Son of Abraham and the rest of the patriarchs; and that He might
therefore, as such, be received, cherished, and worshipped by the Jews.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Abraham begat Isaac</i>. These two, with those who came after them, were the first patriarchs,
the founders of the synagogue and people of God, and of the Kingdom of Christ. They, as types,
foreshadowed Him. (See comment on Genesis, where I have unfolded their genealogies.) I will not here
repeat what has been said. God constantly calls Himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and
even makes a boast, so to say, of this title. Wherefore He chose the posterity of Abraham,
descending through Isaac and Jacob, for His own family and Church, and gave them the sign and pledge
of circumcision. Wherefore God changed Abraham’s name from Abram, <i>i.e</i>., a high father, to
Abraham, that is to say, אב רב המזן, <i>ab rab hamon</i>, or the father of a great multitude—viz.,
of the believing people that should be born of him according to the flesh; in like manner as of
Christ, both Jews and Gentiles, who believe in Him, are born according to the Spirit. Now
Isaac—<i>i.e</i>. laughter—about to be offered up by his father on Mount Moriah, clearly represented
Christ, who was crucified on the same mount, and brought salvation and joy to the whole world.<br /> <br />
<!---->
<i>And Judah begat Pharez and Zara of Thamar</i>. (See what I have said on Tamar, <a href="/Genesis:38:29-lapide">Gen.
	xxxviii. 29.</a>)<br /><br />
Observe that in the genealogy of Christ, with the exception of His Blessed Mother, only four females are made mention
of, three of them harlots—Thamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba—and the fourth a Gentile, Ruth the Moabitess. Rahab, too, was
a Gentile, being an inhabitant of Jericho. If the reason of all this be asked, SS. Jerome, Chrysostom, Ambrose
answer, that it was so because Christ would signify that “He who came for the abolishing and putting away of sins
wished to be born of sinners.” This reason is true, but allegorical. The literal and simple reason is, that these
women were united to their husbands, not in the ordinary way, but after a new and extraordinary manner; and so they
became types of the Church of Christ, which, when the Jews were rejected, was gathered out of the Gentiles by a new
vocation, and after a new manner. Tamar, because Shelah was denied her in marriage, or rather because her union with
him was deferred, using deceit, prostituted herself to Judah. Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, was united to David,
first by adultery, then in marriage. Rahab married Salmon because she hospitably received and protected the Hebrew
spies who were sent by Joshua to Jericho, and so she became of the same faith and religion. Ruth married Boaz when
she had passed with her mother-in-law, Naomi, from Moab into Judæa.<br /><br />
The tropological sense is to show us the vanity of pride of birth, and that true nobility consists, not in ancestry,
but in our own good disposition and virtues. Thus S. Chrysostom. Wherefore let no one be ashamed of his birth, nor
even of vile and wicked ancestors; but let us say with Cicero, “I have outshone my forefathers in virtue.” There can
be no doubt that there are in the ancestry of the most exalted persons, forasmuch as they are sprung from Adam, many
ignoble, worthless, wicked, and infamous persons. Plato, according to Seneca (<i>Epis</i>. 44), is of opinion that
all kings are descended from servants, and that all servants are sprung from kings; that there is no king who has
been entirely free from the plough, and no ploughman who has not been mixed up with kings.<br /><br />
Lastly, Solomon, amongst the other vanities and uncertainties of the world, reckons this: “Because out of prison and
chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a kingdom: and another born king is consumed with poverty.” (<a
	href="/Ecclesiastes:4:14-lapide">Eccles. iv. 14.</a>)

<i>Aminadab</i>. He was prince of the tribe of Judah when the Israelites came out of Egypt, who, when the rest stood
still, fearing to go into the Red Sea, although God had made dry ground through the midst of it, courageously entered
into it, and brought his own tribe safely through, and then the other princes and tribes followed. This is a Hebrew
tradition. To this alludes the verse, <a href="/Song_of_Songs:6:12-lapide">Cant. vi. 12</a>, “My soul made me like the
chariots
of Aminadab.” His son Naasson
succeeded him in the headship of the tribe.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Jesse</i>, or, according to a different punctuation of the Hebrew, <i>Isai</i>. The name itself prefigured Jesus
Christ, who was to be born of him. For Jesse and Jesus are the same word if we consider the root of both, which is to be
found in the Hebrew ישצ <i>iasca, i.e</i>., to save.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Of her which had been the wife of Urias</i>. After Uriah’s death, David married his wife, and of her he begat
Solomon, for Solomon was not born of adultery, but in wedlock. In this passage it is intimated that God did not recall
the promises which He had made to David on account of his adultery with Bathsheba, but, on their repentance, He
confirmed His promises. Whence from Bathsheba and her son Solomon Christ was descended. In truth, Bathsheba herself
became a saintly penitent, and brought up Solomon her son in a holy manner. Yea, she became illustrious for the spirit
of prophecy, as I have shown in <a href="/Proverbs:31:1-lapide">Prov. xxxi. 1</a>, on the words, “The words of king
Lemuel. The
vision which his mother
taught him.” (Vulgate.)<br /><br />
<!---->
<!---->
<i>Now Joram begat Ozias</i>—not directly, but with three generations intervening; for Joram was really the father of
Ahaziah, Ahaziah of Joash, Joash of Amaziah, Amaziah of Azariah or Uzziah, for he had both names. (See <a
	href="/1_Chronicles:3:12-lapide">1 Chron. iii. 12</a>,
&amp;c.)<br /><br />
It is asked why S. Matthew here omits these three links in the genealogy. S. Jerome answers, because the Evangelist
wished to form three exact series of fourteen generations each, on which see <a
	href="#commentary-Matthew:1:17-lapide">ver.
	17.</a> And because Jehoram had allied himself to the most wicked Jezebel and to Ahab, in taking Ahab’s sister, the
impious Athaliah, to wife; for God had sworn that, on account of Ahab’s impiety and idolatry, He would blot out all his
posterity. (<a href="/1_Kings:21:21-lapide">1 Kings xxi. 21</a>, &amp;c.) Posterity in Scripture is reckoned to the
fourth
generation. Here, then, it is
blotted out, forasmuch as it is omitted and obliterated by S. Matthew. Thus S. Hilary, S. Thomas, Jansen, &amp;c. Gaspar
Sanchez gives another reason. He conjectures that Matthew actually wrote as follows: “Joram begat Ochoziah, Ochoziah
begat Joash, Joash begat Amaziah, Amaziah begat Oziah;” but that the copyist, misled by the similarity between Ochoziah
and Oziah, as the names are written in Greek, by a slip of his eye passed over from Ahaziah to Uzziah. Thus Gaspar. But
this would be an enormous blunder, and though one copyist might fall into such an error, it was scarcely possible that
all could. All extant MSS. and Versions are alike here—Greek, Syriac, Latin, Arabic, &amp;c. “<i>Joram begat Ozias</i>,”
not <i>Ahaziah</i>. Besides, if these three generations were inserted, they would make seventeen generations, whereas S.
Matthew says expressly there were fourteen generations.

<i>Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren</i>. Josias begat four sons. The first was Johanan; the second, Jehoiakim,
who is also Eliakim; the third, Jehoahaz, also called Shallum; the fourth, Zedekiah, who is also Mattaniah. Jehoahaz,
although the third son, succeeded his father Josias immediately upon his death; but Pharaoh, King of Egypt, removed him,
and placed his brother Jehoiakim upon the throne. After he had reigned eleven years, Nebuchadnezzar slew him, and gave
the crown to his son Jehoiachin. Him he shortly afterwards dethroned, and made his uncle Zedekiah king. When Zedekiah
rebelled, he took him captive, and put out his eyes; and in him that branch of David’s royal line came to an
end.<br /><br />
<i>The carrying away to Babylon</i>—Greek <i>ε̉πὶ τής μετοικεσίας Βαβυλώνος</i>—that is, about the time of the
transmigration to Babylon, or the Babylonish captivity, in which the Jews were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar to
Babylon.<br /><br />
The transmigration of the Jews to Babylon took place at three different times. The first was in the eleventh year of
King Jehoiakim, when Daniel and Ezekiel were carried away. The second was three months afterwards, when Mordecai,
Esther’s uncle, was carried away, together with Jehoiachin, the son of Jehoiakim. The third, and most complete,
captivity was eleven years afterwards, under King Zedekiah, when almost all the people who were left were taken
away.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Jeconias begat Salathiel</i>. There is a great difficulty here, which Porphyry, the enemy of Christ and of
Christians, was in the habit of bringing forward as insuperable. For this Jeconias, the father of Salathiel, was not the
Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, who is spoken of in the preceding verse, but the son of that Jehoiakim, and the grandson of
Josiah, and consequently there are only thirteen generations, instead of fourteen, as S. Matthew enumerates.<br /><br />
S. Jerome replies that this Jeconias is a different person from Jeconias, the son of Josiah. The former was Jehoiakim,
or <i>Jechonias</i>, and <i>Jeconias</i> by a corruption. The latter is properly Jehoiachin. Josiah begat Jehoiakim, and
Jehoiakim begat Jehoiachin. One generation must, therefore, be supplied in this place. “<i>Now Jeconias begat
	Jechonias</i>,” as some Greek and Latin MSS. do read. That what has been said is correct, is clear from <a
	href="/1_Chronicles:3:15-lapide">1 Chron.
	iii. 15, 16</a>, and <a href="/2_Kings:23-lapide">2 Kings xxiii.</a> and <a
	href="/2_Kings:24-lapide">xxiv.</a><br /><br />
The generation in question was omitted, either by S. Matthew himself, in order to avoid the repetition of the two
similar names, as S. Augustine thinks, or, more probably, through the fault and ignorance of transcribers, who,
mistaking <i>Jechonias</i> for <i>Jeconias</i>, thought that one of the two was redundant, and so omitted it. This was
the opinion of S. Epiphanius.<br /><br />

<i>Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary</i>. You may ask, why is the generation of Christ here derived from
the genealogy of Joseph? Christ was the Son, not of Joseph, but of the Virgin Mary, especially if S. Mary were able, as
it might appear, to marry a man of another tribe, as her cousin Elizabeth, who was of the tribe of Judah, like Mary
herself, married Zachariah, a priest, and therefore of the tribe of Levi.<br /><br />
The answer is, that Jewish women might, indeed, marry into another tribe: but if they themselves, in the failure of
heirs male, became heiresses of their fathers, they were in that case obliged to marry husbands of their own tribe and
family, that their inheritance might not pass by marriage into another tribe. (See the last chapter of <a
	href="/Numbers:36:7-lapide">Numbers, ver.
	7.</a>)<br /><br />
Joakim, the father of the Blessed Virgin, had no male children, a fact which S. Matthew here omits, as something
perfectly well known in the age in which he writes. Hence it became the duty of S. Mary to marry a husband of her own
tribe and family, that is to say, Joseph. Thus the genealogy of Joseph became the genealogy of the Blessed Virgin, and
consequently of Christ, the Lord. Thus, too, it is, that the Fathers teach universally that Joseph and Mary were of the
same tribe and family.<br /><br />
It may be yet further asked, why S. Matthew unfolded the genealogy of Joseph rather than of Mary, since Christ was born
of her alone, being a Virgin? I answer:—First, because among the Jews, and other nations, genealogy is customarily
reckoned through fathers and husbands, not through mothers and wives. Second, because Joseph was the true and lawful
father of Christ, after the manner which I shall explain presently. And Christ was the heir of David’s throne and
sceptre, not through Mary, but through Joseph, according to God’s promise to David, <a href="/2_Samuel:7:12-lapide">2
	Sam. vii. 12</a>; <a href="/Psalms:88-lapide">Ps. lxxxviii.</a> and
<a href="/Psalms:131-lapide">cxxxi.</a> The sceptre, therefore, of Judah devolved upon Jesus Christ, not only by the
promise and gift of God, but by the
right of hereditary succession. For if, by common right, sons succeed to their fathers’ inheritance, when they are only
accounted their sons by common repute, how much more was Christ Joseph’s, His father’s, heir, since He was the Son of
his wife, by the power and the gift of the <b>Holy Ghost</b>? Wherefore as Joseph had a parent’s right over Christ,
indeed, all
rights which parents have over sons, so on the other hand, Christ had, with reference to Joseph, all the rights which
sons have in respect to their parents. He had therefore a right to the kingdom of Israel after Joseph’s death. Hence the
question of the Magi <a href="/Matthew:2:2-lapide">(ii. 2)</a>, &#8220;Where is he that is born King of the Jews?&#8221;
This was what S. Matthew wished
to demonstrate, who, as S. Augustine says, insists, most of all the Evangelists, upon the kingship of Christ. And this
explains why he gives the genealogy of Joseph, rather than of Mary. For she could not be the heiress of the kingdom, so
long as heirs male, like Joseph and others, survived. Whence also it must be said, as a consequence, that the father and
other ancestors of Joseph were first-born, or at least eldest surviving sons of their fathers, so that the right of
reigning devolved upon them.<br /><br />
This is what is meant in the first chapter of S. Luke by the words, &#8220;And the Lord God shall give unto him the
throne of David his father.&#8221; So likewise in <a href="/Genesis:49:10-lapide">Gen. xlix. 10</a>, &#8220;The sceptre
shall not be taken away from Judah,
nor a ruler from his thigh, till he come that is to be sent:&#8221; that is, Christ, who was to restore to Judah the
sceptre, iniquitously taken away by Herod; yea, who was to raise their kingdom to a far higher grandeur, by making it
spiritual instead of corporeal, heavenly instead of earthly, and, instead of temporal, eternal.<br /><br />
Observe the expression, <i>Joseph the husband of Mary</i>. The Arabic has—<i>the spouse of Mary</i>. From this we may
gather that S. Joseph had all the rights of a real husband with regard to the Virgin, and consequently is rightly and
truly called the father of Christ. This is pointed out by S. Augustine.<br /><br />
1. Christ may be said to be the fruit of the marriage of Joseph and Mary, because He was born <i>in</i> wedlock, though
not <i>of</i> wedlock. He may therefore be ascribed either to His father or His mother.<br /><br />
2. Forasmuch as a man and his wife are made one by marriage, as it were but one person in the eye of the law, therefore
they have everything in common, and so all their legitimate children: for I except children born of adultery. They have
the adulterer as their father, and belong to him.<br /><br />
Christ, then, who was the Son of the Virgin Mother of God, was also the Son of Joseph, who was her husband, and
therefore the partner of all her honours and blessings.<br /><br />
Joseph was more truly the father of Christ than one who adopts a son is the father of that son. He is only a father by
adoption, but Joseph was father of Christ by marriage. Hence it follows that Joseph had a father’s authority over
Christ, and therefore the utmost solicitude and affection for him. And Christ in return cherished, loved, and honoured
Joseph as a father, and was obedient to him, as is plain from <a href="/Luke:2:51">Luke ii. 51.</a> &#8220;This
subjection,&#8221; as Gerson
says, &#8220;marks at once the unspeakable humility of Christ, and the incomparable dignity of Joseph and
Mary.&#8221;<br /><br />
3. Because Christ properly belonged to the family of Joseph: for He belonged to His mother’s family as His mother
herself belonged to Joseph’s. There was therefore upon earth one most noble, yea, divine and heavenly family, of which
the father and ruler was Joseph; the mother, the Blessed Virgin; the son, Christ. In it were the three most exalted and
excellent persons of the whole world; first, Christ, both God and man; secondly, the Virgin Mother of God, most closely
united to Christ; and thirdly, Joseph, the father of Christ by marriage.<br /><br />
The common herd of men, yea, many of this world’s wise ones, think of Joseph only as a poor and despised carpenter. But
the more despised and unknown he was upon earth, so much the greater is his glory in heaven. Wherefore Gregory XV. hath
lately decreed that his Festival shall be celebrated as a <i>Double</i> by the whole Church on the 19th of March. And
this is a well deserved honour; for consider, from what I am about to subjoin, how great were his prerogatives, his
office, and dignity above all other men.<br /><br />
1. Joseph was the husband of the Blessed Virgin, and the father of Christ, as I have already shown. He was therefore the
head and superior both of the Virgin, and of Christ as He was man. Hence,<br /><br />
2. There was singular love and reverence, on the part both of the Blessed Virgin and of Christ, towards Joseph. Whence
John Gerson, Chancellor of Paris (<i>Serm. de Nativ. B.V.M</i>.), exclaims, &#8220;O, altogether wonderful is thy
exaltation, O Joseph, incomparable thy dignity, that the Mother of God, the Queen of Heaven, the lady of the world,
should not disdain to call thee lord!&#8221; S. Gregory Nazianzen (<i>Orat</i>. 11), denotes and celebrates the
excellence of the husband of his sister, Gorgonia, by this one title, that he was Gorgonia’s husband. &#8220;Do you
wish,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that I should describe the man? He was her husband, and I know of nothing more that I need
say.&#8221; You may say the same of S. Joseph. Do you desire to know who and how great he was? He was the husband of the
Mother of God.<br /><br />
3. The ministry and office of Joseph was most noble, in that it pertains to the order of the hypostatic union of the
Word with our flesh. For Joseph exercised all his labours and actions in immediate proximity to the Person of Christ. He
nourished, cherished, and guarded Christ, and taught Him his art as a carpenter, according to the common opinion of the
Doctors. Hear Franc. Suarez (3 <i>part. qu&aelig;st</i>. 29, <i>disp</i>. 8, <i>sect</i>. 1):—&#8220;There are some
offices which pertain directly to the order of grace making grateful, and in this the Apostles hold the highest rank,
and therefore need greater assistance of grace than all others. There are, again, other offices which pertain to the
order of the hypostatic union, which is <i>in genere</i> a higher order, as is plain from the motherhood of God in the
Blessed Virgin. And in this order S. Joseph exercised his ministry.&#8221;<br /><br />
4. Joseph, by his familiar and constant companionship with Christ and the Blessed Virgin, was made a sharer in their
divine secrets, and daily beheld and imitated their lofty virtues.<br /><br />
5. Joseph was a person of the utmost sanctity, and endowed by God with singular gifts, both of nature and grace, so that
in that age there was no man more holy, or more worthy the betrothal of the Mother of God. Whence Suarez thinks it
probable that Joseph was superior to the Apostles and John the Baptist in grace and glory, because his office was more
excellent than theirs; for it is more to be the father and governor of Christ than His preacher and forerunner. He adds
that when Joseph espoused the Blessed Virgin, he was of mature age, and died before the Crucifixion. This is why in the
Passion of Christ no mention is made of Joseph. Lastly, he rose with Christ in common with the rest of the patriarchs,
of whom mention is made in <a href="/Matthew:27:52-lapide">Matt. xxvii. 52</a>—&#8220;Many bodies of the saints which
slept arose.&#8221; These are the
things in which Joseph was pre-eminent.<br /><br />
<i>Of whom was born Jesus</i>. The form of expression is here changed The Evangelist does not say, <i>Joseph begat
	Jesus</i>, as he had said of Abraham and the rest. Neither does he say, <i>Mary begat Jesus</i>, but of whom was
born Jesus. By this expression he signifies—1. That Jesus was born of Mary, not by natural means, but by
supernatural—that is to say, by the operation of the <b>Holy Ghost</b>. 2. That Jesus was not sprung from His father
Joseph,
but born of His mother alone, she being a virgin, and therefore that Joseph had no other connection with the genealogy
of Christ than by right of his wife, the Virgin Mary.<br /><br />
Well does S. Bernard say (<i>Hom</i>. 1 <i>super Missus est</i>)—&#8220;Very beautiful was the mingling of humility and
virginity; nor is that soul in only a slight degree pleasing unto God, in which humility commends virginity, and
virginity adorns humility; but of what veneration must she be worthy whose fruitfulness exalteth humility, and
childbirth consecrates virginity?&#8221; And again—&#8220;Such a nativity became God, that He should not be born save of
a Virgin: such a birth became a Virgin, that she should bring forth only God.&#8221; It was fitting that, as Christ had
a Father in heaven, He should have no father upon earth, but only a mother; for He who was without a mother in heaven
(Gr. <i>&#945;&#777;&#956;&#942;&#964;&#969;&#961;</i>) was without a father on earth (Gr.
<i>&#945;&#777;&#960;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#961;</i>). For it behoved that the Conception and the Birth of Christ should be
removed as far as possible from original sin—that as it was not right that He should contract it, so neither should it
be possible. And in this He was superior to His mother; for she, although conceived without sin by the singular
preservation of God, nevertheless was bound, through that natural conception of herself whereby she was born of Joachim
and Anna by natural generation from Adam, to have contracted it, unless it had been prevented by the grace of God.
Lastly, it behoved that the Birth of Christ should be most divinely pure, that it might powerfully commend virginity and
chastity to us. Whence S. Gregory Nazianzen (<i>Orat</i>. 38, <i>de Nativ. in principio</i>) says, &#8220;Christ was
born of a virgin: O ye women, do ye then cherish virginity, that ye may be able to be mothers of Christ.&#8221; And
Cyril of Jerusalem says, &#8220;Christ was born that He might make virgins; much more, therefore, ought a virgin to keep
chaste her body.&#8221;<br /><br />
The expression—<i>Of whom was born Jesus</i>—signifies that the Virgin was the real mother of Jesus—<i>i.e</i>., of
that Man who, being hypostatically united with God, was both God and man. Therefore was she truly the mother of God. For
although she was not the mother of Deity, yet did she give birth to God, because she was mother of that Man. For that
Man was God, therefore the Blessed Virgin was mother of God.<br /><br />
The reason, <i>&agrave; priori</i>, is identity of Person, because there is but one Person, and that a Divine Person, in
Christ. Hence the attributes of either nature can be predicated of Him; and there becomes a joint participation of the
peculiarities of each; so that this Man may be called God, and in return, God may be called Man, the Son of the Virgin,
and it can be said that God suffered and was crucified, &amp;c. For one Person is presupposed in these expressions, who
gathereth up into Himself all the actions and passions of both natures. Wherefore the Person of the Son of God, who is
God, is rightly spoken of as born of the Virgin Mary, but according to His human, not His divine nature.<br /><br />
The surpassing dignity, therefore, of the Blessed Virgin is here indicated: for such is the motherhood of God, that from
her He received His own, that is to say, His human substances, such as flesh, bones, blood; and received it in such sort
that He cherished, loved, and reverenced her as His mother, and was obedient to her as a mother, and spoke of her as
&#8220;mother.&#8221; Whence S. Bernard exclaims in admiration, &#8220;A twofold wonder, a twofold miracle; God obeys a
woman—humility without a parallel; and a woman is the head of God—dignity beyond compare!&#8221;<br /><br />
The Virgin Mother of God possessed the same right and authority over Christ which other mothers have over their own
sons. Yea, she had more than other mothers have, because she was more the mother of Christ than other women are mothers
of their sons, for a reason which I shall adduce presently.<br /><br />
S. Thomas (I <i>part. qu&aelig;st</i>. 25, <i>art</i>. 6) teaches that God could not perform a greater work than the
Incarnation of the Word, and the maternity of the Blessed Virgin, because she is the very Mother of God—God than whom
nothing greater can be imagined. Hence Bede saith, &#8220;O most blessed Virgin, in thee alone that rich, yea, more than
rich, King emptied Himself.&#8221; For to be Mother of God is the highest affinity, consanguinity, and union with God.
By that motherhood the Blessed Virgin Mary is in as close relationship with God as a mother is with her son.<br /><br />
From this dignity of Mother of God, there follow all the gifts and privileges which have been granted to the Blessed
Virgin by God above all men and angels. For as the Humanity of Christ, being united to the Word, receiveth from the
<b>Word</b>
such gifts and privileges as are becoming to such a union—I mean such as may exalt that Humanity, and
render It, as it were, worthy of union with the <b>Word</b>
so, in like manner, God showered upon Mary all the gifts and graces which befitted such a Mother of
Christ and Spouse of God. Whence you may draw this conclusion—Mary is the Mother of God, therefore she is far more
excellent than all the angels, even the Cherubim and Seraphim. She is the Mother of God, therefore she is Queen and
Lady of heaven and earth. She is the Mother of God, therefore whatsoever privilege has been granted to any of the
Saints, that she obtains in a more excellent degree.<br /><br />
3. <i>Of whom was born Jesus</i>, signifies that He was born of His Mother only, so that she alone contributed to
Christ all that flesh and substance which other fathers and mothers are wont to contribute conjointly to their
children. For sons derive a portion of their substance from their fathers, a portion from their mothers. Wherefore
the Blessed Virgin contributed more to Christ than other mothers are wont to contribute to their sons, because she
alone was, in a manner, both father and mother of Christ.<br /><br />
Hence it follows—1. That the Blessed Virgin hath more right in Christ than other mothers have in their sons. 2. That
Mary had far greater love for Christ, and Christ for her, than other mothers have for their sons, and other sons for
their mothers, both because she alone bare (<i>genuit</i>) Him, as well as because she bare Him not after the
natural, but after the supernatural and divine order. So, too, the love which, in other sons, is divided between
father and mother, in Christ was united, and applied wholly to His Mother. And thus she felt, as it were, with a
duplicated grief the pains of Christ upon the Cross, and experienced a duplicated joy at His
Resurrection.<br /><br />
4. The expression, <i>of whom was born</i>, signifies that the <b>Holy Ghost</b> was the most potent and efficient cause
of
the Nativity of Christ, who, within the Blessed Virgin, of her most pure blood, formed the Body of Christ, organized
It, and gave It life, and hypostatically united It to the <b>Word</b>
in the first moment of Its conception. Still the Blessed Virgin was a secondary cause, and a true Mother
of Christ for the purpose of generation, not merely as passively furnishing the material, but as actively concurring
therein by way of forming, disposing, and organizing that material. See Francis Suarez, 3 <i>p</i>., <i>q</i>. 3, 2
<i>art</i>., 4 <i>ac</i>., <i>q</i>. 33, <i>art</i>. 4, where he teaches that Christ’s generation of the Virgin was
supernatural, as far as its manner and swiftness were concerned, because, in one moment, it was perfected by the
<b>Holy Ghost</b> as the efficient cause. And so the action whereby Mary became a mother was natural; the mode was
supernatural.<br /><br />
<i>Was born Jesus</i>. The Word was made Flesh. God became Man. The Son of God was made the Son of the Virgin. This,
as S. Thomas teaches at length, was the highest and greatest of all the works of God. At this work the Angels and
all the Saints have ever been and are amazed in wonder. For in It God manifested His highest power by uniting man to
God, clay to the Word, earth to heaven. He manifested also the highest wisdom, that
He, who in His Godhead might not suffer to redeem us, put on, in the Virgin’s womb, flesh, whereby He might be able
to suffer, and to make satisfaction to the Father for our sins. He manifested also the highest justice, because by
reason of the dignity of His Person, He makes satisfaction upon equal terms, as it were, to the wrath and justice of
God, by suffering death upon the Cross. And He manifested the utmost goodness, because He emptied Himself, that He
might replenish us with His gifts. He was made the Son of man that He might make us sons of God, as S. Augustine
says. He was born on earth, that man might be born in heaven, as S. Gregory says.<br /><br />
<i>Who is called Christ</i>: that is, who is the Messiah, or the Christ, the Redeemer of the world, promised to the
Fathers. And henceforth He can and ought to be called Messiah, or Christ in His own right, and therefore now He is
verily so called by all the faithful.<br /><br />
How this genealogy of S. Matthew is reconcilable with that of S. Luke, I will unfold in my commentary on the third
chapter of S. Luke.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David, are fourteen generations. And from David to the
	transmigration</i> (the Syriac has <i>exile</i>) <i>of Babylon are fourteen generations: and from the transmigration
	of Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations</i>. From Abraham, therefore, unto Christ are forty-two generations.
S. Luke (chap. iii.) enumerates seventy-seven generations, but he places no stress upon the number as S. Matthew does.
Though S. Augustine, c. 2, <i>de consensu Evang</i>., c. 4., is of opinion that entire remission and abolition of all
sins, which is effected through Christ, is denoted by the seventy-seven generations. Whence Christ commanded that
forgiveness should be extended to an erring brother seventy times seven. (Matt. xviii. 22.)<br /><br />
By generations, you must understand all the persons, both those begetting and those begotten. These are the fourteen.
For the Greek is not <i>&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</i>, <i>i.e. generation</i>, properly called, but
<i>&#947;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#945;</i>, <i>i.e. offspring, race, family, and children, the duration of the life of one
	man</i>. For the generations, exactly numbered, are only thirteen in the first Tesseradecade, as you will see if you
count the recurrence of the word &#8220;begat;&#8221; which word is repeated thirteen times; because in it alone Abraham
is reckoned the first, and David the last generation. But in the second Tesseradecade, David, the first in it, is not
reckoned; nor yet in the third, Jeconias the first name; because those persons have been already named and enumerated as
the last in the second and third Tesseradecades. Therefore, in the third Tesseradecade, one generation must be
added—namely, Jehoiakim begat Jehoiachin—in order that it may consist of fourteen generations; that is to say, of
fourteen persons begetting and begotten, as I have already said. All the generations then are precisely forty-one; but
the persons begetting and begotten are forty-two, because the generation of the first—namely, Abraham—is not reckoned
here, but is presupposed as being known from the Book of Genesis.<br /><br />
You may ask, with what object S. Matthew so accurately enumerates these three Tesseradecades of generations? The answer
is, because he wishes to pass in review the threefold condition of the Jewish people—the first, the <i>quasi</i>
democratic state under the several Patriarchs and Judges, such as Othniel, Gideon, Samson, Eli, Samuel, &amp;c., who
presided over Israel from Abraham to David; the second, the monarchical, under kings, as David and his descendants,
until the captivity; the third, the aristocratic, under dukes and pontiffs, as Judas, Jonathan, Simon, and the rest of
the Maccabees, from the Babylonish captivity unto Christ. Matthew signifies that this threefold condition and government
of the people was thrice changed, and must be a fourth time changed by Christ, and ended in Christ, who brought in an
eternal kingdom. Thus the Fathers and commentators <i>passim</i>.<br /><br />
Whence Nazianzen, in his poem on the genealogy of Christ says:—<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	Thus he deduced a royal race, and kingly sceptre.
</blockquote>
Maldonatus adds a medical analogy. In fevers, and other diseases, physicians call the fourteenth the critical day, and
the most perilous. Agreeably, therefore, to the nature of man, after each period of fourteen generations, God seems to
have wished to change the condition of His people, that one form of government, as it were, growing sick and failing, a
better one might be born and succeed it, until, through Christ, the best of all should be substituted, which should heal
and correct the defects and weakness of the three preceding, and establish the kingdom of the Church, flourishing,
sound, and eternal.<br /><br />
Lastly, Matthew enumerates forty-two generations by three Tesseradecades, so as to make it a probable conjecture in the
mind of his reader, that it was fitting that Christ should come after this exact number of generations. For as there
were fourteen generations before the kingdom of the Jews was established, fourteen during its continuance, after which,
during fourteen generations, it evidently declined, so, by a probable conjecture, it might be supposed, that after these
last fourteen generations, the kingdom fading away, it was to be restored to a better state by Messiah. For as there
were fourteen generations before, and fourteen in the kingdom, so there were as many after the kingdom of Israel until
Christ. Again, before the kingdom the promise of Christ was made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; in the kingdom to David
and Solomon; after the kingdom the same promise was repeated to Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, &amp;c., that there might be
a feeling that all the promises made concerning Christ, both before, during, and after the kingdom were ended and
fulfilled in Christ.<br /><br />
Abraham begins, David ends the first Tesseradecade; Solomon begins, Jehoiakim or Jehoiachin ends the second; Jehoiakim
or Jehoiachin begins, Christ ends the third. And He is the end of the law, and the deliverer of the captive people and
the captive world. So Francisc. Lucas. For the Jews knew from the decline and failure of their commonwealth, and
especially when the sceptre was taken away from Judah by Herod, according to the prophecy of Jacob, Genesis xlix. 10,
that the Advent of Messiah might certainly be expected. Whence their kingdom being broken up, and this sceptre
transferred, S. Matthew here teaches that Messiah was now come, and was none other than Jesus Christ. And thus he would
persuade the Jews to believe in Him. <i>Symbolically</i>, Origen (<i>Hom</i>. 27 <i>in Num</i>.) and S. Jerome
(<i>Epist. ad Fabiolam de</i> 42 <i>Mansion</i>.), remark, that those forty-two generations correspond to the forty-two
stations of the Israelites in the wilderness, by which they arrived at the land of Canaan promised to Abraham.
Similarly, through the forty-two generations we arrive at the Messiah, or the Christ, promised to the same Abraham, and
through Christ, at the land of the living, promised to the saints in heaven.<br /><br />
Again, the number fourteen, because it contains twice seven, by which the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost is
signified, denotes the gift of the same Holy Spirit in two-fold abundance to man, as it was in Christ, who, indeed, by a
like symbol, having suffered on the fourteenth day of the month Nisan, when the moon was full, redeemed us by His death,
and merited abundance of graces for us. Wherefore the Psalmist sings concerning Him, Ps. lxxi.: &#8220;In his days shall
the righteous flourish, yea and abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth.&#8221; Listen to S. Ambrose,
<i>Oration on the death of Theodosius</i>: &#8220;In the number fourteen we have received man’s perfection; whence the
Lord’s Passover received the form of its celebration, on the fourteenth day of the moon. Wherefore he who celebrates the
Passover ought to be perfect, ought to love the Lord Jesus, who, loving His own people with a perfect love, offered
Himself to His Passion. A notable mystery is in the number, since the Father delivered up his only Son for us all, when
the moon was shining with a full orb of light. For like this is the Church, which piously celebrates the Passover of our
Lord Jesus Christ. It abideth for ever, like the moon at the full. Whosoever shall well celebrate here the Lord’s
Passover, shall be in light, everlastingly.&#8221;<br /><br />
<i>Anagogically</i>, the number forty-two is composed of six into seven, For six times seven makes forty-two. The six
denotes the labours of this life, whereby we come to the seven, or the sabbath of rest and eternal felicity. For in the
six first days of the world God made all things in heaven and earth; but in the seventh day, or the sabbath, He rested
from all His work.<br /><br />
<i>Tropologically</i>, by this forty-fold number of generations is signified the life of the body, as compounded of the
four elements. For this life standeth in keeping the ten commandments of God, which are perfected by the four Gospels.
For ten into four makes forty. So Salmeron, so even S. Augustine, and from him Peter Bongus, <i>On the Mysteries of
	Numbers, Num. XIV</i>.: &#8220;The three divisions,&#8221; he says, &#8220;in the generation of Christ, hint at the
doctrine of the Holy Trinity, which is laid down concordantly by the Law and the Gospel. For three signifies faith in
the Trinity, four the evangelical doctrine, ten the institution of the Law.&#8221; The same author adds shortly
afterwards: &#8220;That the number fourteen should be thrice repeated signifies true religion. For four and ten indicate
the New and Old Testament. For the way to Christ is preached through the Ten Commandments of the Law, and the four
Gospels; so, however, that we should consecrate whatever is ascribed to the Trinity, that is, to God, because no
commandment is fulfilled unless this number is preserved in the worship of God. By the type of this number, moreover,
Ezekiel (chap. xl.) beheld in the fourteenth year after the smiting of the city, a new city, even the Church, which
Christ, born and dying, founded in the fourteenth generation after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldees, as
Cassiodorus remarks (<i>in Ps</i>. xiv., <i>sub finem</i>). Lastly, in the forty second year after Christ’s Passion,
Jerusalem was utterly destroyed by Titus and Vespasian to avenge His death—as S. Jerome observes on the words of the
Psalm: &#8220;In the next generation let his name be clean put out.&#8221;<br /><br />
