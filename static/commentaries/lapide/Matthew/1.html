The book of the generation.—Thus it is verbally in the Greek, Latin, Syrian, Arabic, Egyptian,
Persian texts. But the Ethiopian has <i>the genealogy of Jesus Christ</i>. Matthew here seems to
imitate Moses. Listen to what blessed Peter Damian says in his Sermon on S. Matthew:
<blockquote>
	As Moses is not improperly placed before the prophets and all who have written anything in the Old Testament, so
	Matthew rightly takes precedence of all who are found to have written in the New Testament. For as
	Moses compiled an account of the origin of the world, so has Matthew described the
	rising newness of the Church, as it were of a spiritual world. Hence it has been provided that, the
	Holy Ghost guiding the pen, both Moses and S. Matthew placed the same commencement to their
	respective works, saying, “The Book of the Generation.”
</blockquote>
So far Damian. Now Moses, in <a href="/Genesis-1:1_lapide">Gen. v. 1</a>, thus begins the account of the genealogy and
race of Adam, the first formed man—
<i>The Book of generation of Adam</i>: for Adam was a type of Christ. For as Adam was the father of the mortal life of
all men, so is
Christ the Father of the immortal life of the faithful, as S. Paul teaches, <a href="/Romans-1:14_lapide">Rom. v.
	14</a>, &amp;c., and
<a href="/1Corinthians-15:47_lapide">1 Cor. xv. 47</a> et seq. The Hebrew is תולדות&nbsp; ספר <i>sepher toledoth,
	i.e</i>., the book, or
catalogue, and enumeration of the generations of Adam. For, in the <a href="/Genesis-5:1_lapide">5th of Genesis</a>,
many, indeed all
the generations are given by which the human race was propagated from Adam to Noah and the Flood,
whence it is probable that S. Matthew, who alludes to Moses, wrote likewise in Hebrew, in this
passage, <i>sepher toledoth, i.e</i>., the book of the generations, in the plural. The LXX, however,
in <a href="/Genesis-5:1_lapide">Gen. v.</a>, have translated <i>βίβλος γενέσεως</i>, <i>the Book of the generation</i>,
in the
singular, because the generation of Adam was one, by which he, as it were the patriarch of the whole
human race, begat Seth, which generation was afterwards continued by Seth and his posterity, and was
propagated as far as Noah. The Greek interpreter of S. Matthew, and the Latin Vulgate, which was
translated from the Greek, here followed the LXX, because properly there is related the generation
of Christ alone, whose origin indeed is derived from Abraham, through many generations of
forefathers, and is brought down to Christ. As, therefore, Adam was the beginning or origin of the
old world, so is Christ of the new and better world, whence he is called by <a href="/Isaiah-9:6_lapide">Isaiah (ix.
	6)</a>, “The
Father of the coming age.” (Vulgate). Hence also Virgil, following the Cumæan Sibyl, sings thus
concerning Him, Eclogue iv.:—
<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	Now the last age of Cumæan Verses is come,<br />
	Afresh the great cycle of ages begins;<br />
	Returneth the Virgin, Saturnian Kingdoms return:<br />
	The heavenly Offspring descends from on high:
</blockquote>
and adds:—<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	Dear increase of God, true Offspring of Jove,<br />
	Begin, Boy, by smiles thy Mother to know.
</blockquote>
It is plain that these things were spoken by the Sibyl concerning Christ; but Virgil, either through
ignorance or flattery, has transferred them to Pollio, the son of Asinius Pollio, the Roman
Consul.<br /><br />
Note, 1st, <i>Book</i> here is the same as catalogue, or enumeration, or description, whence the
Syriac translation, כתכא, <i>ketobo, i.e</i>., a description, or writing. For this is the exact
meaning of the Hebrew, <i>sepher</i>, to which the Greek <i>βίβλος</i> and Latin
<i>liber</i> correspond. In a like sense, the paper in which was recorded the putting away of a wife
by her husband was called a <i>Book of divorcement</i>. So the <i>Book of the righteous </i>is the
catalogue in which the names and acts of the righteous are recorded. <i>The Book of Life </i>is the
catalogue of the elect, who are written in the mind of God as in a book. Cicero called a catalogue
of names, <i>a book of names</i>.<br /><br />Note, 2nd, the word <i>generation</i>. First, and most
evidently, it is the same as the race, or genealogy of Christ. Second, the generation of Christ is
the conception and birth of Christ. See <a href="/Matthew-1:18_lapide">ver. 18</a>. <i>The birth </i>(<i>γέννησις</i>)
<i>of Jesus Christ was on this wise</i>. Third, as Maldonatus observes, “the generation of Christ is
the life of Christ.” For Matthew, in the Gospel, relates the history of the whole course of the life
of Christ. Fourth, the Hebrew <i>toledoth</i> properly signifies generations, many of which
intervened between Adam and Christ. The steps in Jacob’s ladder, above which God stood, represented
these generations—those steps, I mean, by which the angels ascended from earth to heaven. For as
this ladder joined, as it were, earth to heaven, and Jacob to God, so this series of generations
united all the patriarchs to Christ, who was made Flesh, and so united all men to Himself and to
God.<br /><br />
<i>Son of David, i.e</i>., descendant of David: for the Hebrews call all male lineal descendants,
sons. The Evangelist places David first, then Abraham: 1st, because David was the nearer to Christ,
and through him Christ reaches to Abraham; 2nd, because thus, in a more compendious manner, without
repetition, Christ’s genealogy is stated. He wished to impress this fact, that Christ was descended
from Abraham through David. So S. Jerome. 3rd, and chiefly, because the promise of God made to David
concerning Christ, as about to be born of his posterity, was the later, more special, and more
glorious promise, as S. Chrysostom, Theophilus, Euthym., teach. Hence the Jews constantly call their
Messiah the Son of David. Hence on Palm Sunday, when Christ entered into Jerusalem, they hailed Him
as Messiah: <i>Hosanna to the Son of David, i.e</i>., O Lord, save our Messiah, speaking of Him as
David’s son and heir. Lastly, by the title, <i>Son of David</i>, the nobility of the race from
whence Messiah sprung is hinted at, as also His kingdom, viz., that He too should be a king, as
being the Son of David, a king, according to that divine voice of the Archangel Gabriel to the
Blessed Virgin, “He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God
shall give unto him the throne of David his father: and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for
ever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.” (S. Luke i. 31.) For this reason the prophets
everywhere speak of Christ as David’s son and heir, thus <a href="/Isaiah-9:7_lapide">Is. ix. 7</a>,
<a href="/Leviticus-3:1_lapide">lv. 3</a>; <a href="/Jeremiah-25:5_lapide">Jer. xxv. 5</a>; <a
	href="/Ezra-34:23_lapide">Ez. xxxiv.
	23</a>, <a href="/Ezra-37:25_lapide">xxxvii. 25</a>, &amp;c.<br /><br />The first promise which was made to David
concerning Christ, that He
should spring from him, and reign for ever, is found <a href="2Samuel-7:12_lapide">2 Sam. vii. 12</a>; the same was
confirmed,
<a href="Psalms-88:1_lapide">Ps. lxxxviii</a>. and <a href="Psalms-131:1_lapide">cxxxi.</a>; and repeated to Solomon,
David’s Son,
<a href="1Kings-9:5_lapide">1 Kings ix. 5</a>. When, therefore, S. Matthew says, <i>Jesus Christ the Son of David</i>,
he means that all these promises were now fulfilled in Christ. Thus S. Chrysostom 2; Theophilus, Euthym.; Irenæus, lib.
8, c. 8; S. Ambrose,
lib. 3 <i>in Luc</i>., c. 3; and others.<br /><br />
<i>Son of Abraham</i>. The word Son here may be referred either to David or to Christ. For David, as
well as Christ, was a son, <i>i.e</i>. a descendant, of Abraham. It signifies, therefore, that
Christ, through David His father, was also the Son of Abraham, who was the father of them that
believe, and of the ancient Church. The first express promise concerning Christ was made to him.
(Gen. xxii. 18.) Now, from the birth of Abraham to the birth of Christ there were 2,000 years; from
the death of David to Christ, 1,013 years. So great was the antiquity of the oracles and promises of
God concerning Christ; so constant and sure was God’s faithfulness in fulfilling them. And this is
why S. Matthew so carefully derives the genealogy of Christ from Abraham, even through forty-two
generations, in order that he might show the Jews that Jesus Christ was the true Messiah promised to
Abraham, and that He was the Son of Abraham and the rest of the patriarchs; and that He might
therefore, as such, be received, cherished, and worshipped by the Jews.<br /><br />

<i>Abraham begat Isaac</i>. These two, with those who came after them, were the first patriarchs, the founders of the synagogue and people of God, and of the Kingdom of Christ. They, as types, foreshadowed Him. (See comment on Genesis, where I have unfolded their genealogies.) I will not here repeat what has been said. God constantly calls Himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and even makes a boast, so to say, of this title. Wherefore He chose the posterity of Abraham, descending through Isaac and Jacob, for His own family and Church, and gave them the sign and pledge of circumcision. Wherefore God changed Abraham’s name from Abram, <i>i.e</i>., a high father, to Abraham, that is to say, אב רב המזן, <i>ab rab hamon</i>, or the father of a great multitude—viz., of the believing people that should be born of him according to the flesh; in like manner as of Christ, both Jews and Gentiles, who believe in Him, are born according to the Spirit. Now Isaac—<i>i.e</i>. laughter—about to be offered up by his father on Mount Moriah, clearly represented Christ, who was crucified on the same mount, and brought salvation and joy to the whole world.
