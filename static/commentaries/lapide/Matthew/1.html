The book of the generation.—Thus it is verbally in the Greek, Latin, Syrian, Arabic, Egyptian,
Persian texts. But the Ethiopian has <i>the genealogy of Jesus Christ</i>. Matthew here seems to
imitate Moses. Listen to what blessed Peter Damian says in his Sermon on S. Matthew:
<blockquote>
	As Moses is not improperly placed before the prophets and all who have written anything in the Old
	Testament, so Matthew rightly takes precedence of all who are found to have written in the New
	Testament. For as Moses compiled an account of the origin of the world, so has Matthew described
	the rising newness of the Church, as it were of a spiritual world. Hence it has been provided
	that, the Holy Ghost guiding the pen, both Moses and S. Matthew placed the same commencement to
	their respective works, saying, “The Book of the Generation.”
</blockquote>
So far Damian. Now Moses, in <a href="/Genesis:1-lapide#scripture=Genesis:1:1">Gen. v. 1</a>, thus
begins the account of the genealogy and race of Adam, the first formed man—
<i>The Book of generation of Adam</i>: for Adam was a type of Christ. For as Adam was the father of
the mortal life of all men, so is Christ the Father of the immortal life of the faithful, as S. Paul
teaches, <a href="/Romans:1-lapide#scripture-Romans:1:14">Rom. v. 14</a>, &amp;c., and
<a href="/1_Corinthians:15-lapide#scripture-1_Corinthans:15:47">1 Cor. xv. 47</a> et seq. The Hebrew
is תולדות&nbsp; ספר <i>sepher toledoth, i.e</i>., the book, or catalogue, and enumeration of the
generations of Adam. For, in the <a href="/Genesis:5-lapide">5th of Genesis</a>, many, indeed all
the generations are given by which the human race was propagated from Adam to Noah and the Flood,
whence it is probable that S. Matthew, who alludes to Moses, wrote likewise in Hebrew, in this
passage, <i>sepher toledoth, i.e</i>., the book of the generations, in the plural. The LXX, however,
in <a href="/Genesis:5-lapide">Gen. v.</a>, have translated <i>βίβλος γενέσεως</i>,
<i>the Book of the generation</i>, in the singular, because the generation of Adam was one, by which
he, as it were the patriarch of the whole human race, begat Seth, which generation was afterwards
continued by Seth and his posterity, and was propagated as far as Noah. The Greek interpreter of S.
Matthew, and the Latin Vulgate, which was translated from the Greek, here followed the LXX, because
properly there is related the generation of Christ alone, whose origin indeed is derived from
Abraham, through many generations of forefathers, and is brought down to Christ. As, therefore, Adam
was the beginning or origin of the old world, so is Christ of the new and better world, whence he is
called by <a href="/Isaiah:9-lapide#scripture-Isaiah:9:6">Isaiah (ix. 6)</a>, “The Father of the
coming age.” (Vulgate). Hence also Virgil, following the Cumæan Sibyl, sings thus concerning Him,
Eclogue iv.:— <br /><br />
<blockquote>
	Now the last age of Cumæan Verses is come,<br />
	Afresh the great cycle of ages begins;<br />
	Returneth the Virgin, Saturnian Kingdoms return:<br />
	The heavenly Offspring descends from on high:
</blockquote>
and adds:—<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	Dear increase of God, true Offspring of Jove,<br />
	Begin, Boy, by smiles thy Mother to know.
</blockquote>
It is plain that these things were spoken by the Sibyl concerning Christ; but Virgil, either through
ignorance or flattery, has transferred them to Pollio, the son of Asinius Pollio, the Roman
Consul.<br /><br />
Note, 1st, <i>Book</i> here is the same as catalogue, or enumeration, or description, whence the
Syriac translation, כתכא, <i>ketobo, i.e</i>., a description, or writing. For this is the exact
meaning of the Hebrew, <i>sepher</i>, to which the Greek <i>βίβλος</i> and Latin
<i>liber</i> correspond. In a like sense, the paper in which was recorded the putting away of a wife
by her husband was called a <i>Book of divorcement</i>. So the <i>Book of the righteous </i>is the
catalogue in which the names and acts of the righteous are recorded. <i>The Book of Life </i>is the
catalogue of the elect, who are written in the mind of God as in a book. Cicero called a catalogue
of names, <i>a book of names</i>.<br /><br />Note, 2nd, the word <i>generation</i>. First, and most
evidently, it is the same as the race, or genealogy of Christ. Second, the generation of Christ is
the conception and birth of Christ. See <a href="#scripture-Matthew:1:18">ver. 18</a>.
<i>The birth </i>(<i>γέννησις</i>) <i>of Jesus Christ was on this wise</i>. Third, as Maldonatus
observes, “the generation of Christ is the life of Christ.” For Matthew, in the Gospel, relates the
history of the whole course of the life of Christ. Fourth, the Hebrew <i>toledoth</i> properly
signifies generations, many of which intervened between Adam and Christ. The steps in Jacob’s
ladder, above which God stood, represented these generations—those steps, I mean, by which the
angels ascended from earth to heaven. For as this ladder joined, as it were, earth to heaven, and
Jacob to God, so this series of generations united all the patriarchs to Christ, who was made Flesh,
and so united all men to Himself and to God.<br /><br />
<i>Son of David, i.e</i>., descendant of David: for the Hebrews call all male lineal descendants,
sons. The Evangelist places David first, then Abraham: 1st, because David was the nearer to Christ,
and through him Christ reaches to Abraham; 2nd, because thus, in a more compendious manner, without
repetition, Christ’s genealogy is stated. He wished to impress this fact, that Christ was descended
from Abraham through David. So S. Jerome. 3rd, and chiefly, because the promise of God made to David
concerning Christ, as about to be born of his posterity, was the later, more special, and more
glorious promise, as S. Chrysostom, Theophilus, Euthym., teach. Hence the Jews constantly call their
Messiah the Son of David. Hence on Palm Sunday, when Christ entered into Jerusalem, they hailed Him
as Messiah: <i>Hosanna to the Son of David, i.e</i>., O Lord, save our Messiah, speaking of Him as
David’s son and heir. Lastly, by the title, <i>Son of David</i>, the nobility of the race from
whence Messiah sprung is hinted at, as also His kingdom, viz., that He too should be a king, as
being the Son of David, a king, according to that divine voice of the Archangel Gabriel to the
Blessed Virgin, “He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God
shall give unto him the throne of David his father: and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for
ever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.” (<a href="/Luke:1-lapide#scripture-Luke:1:31">S. Luke i. 31.</a>) For
this reason the prophets everywhere speak of Christ as David’s son and heir, thus
<a href="/Isaiah:9:7-lapide">Is. ix. 7</a>, <a href="/Leviticus:3-lapide">lv. 3</a>;
<a href="/Jeremiah:25-lapide#scripture-Jeremiah:25:5">Jer. xxv. 5</a>;
<a href="/Ezra:34:23-lapide">Ez. xxxiv. 23</a>,
<a href="/Ezra:37-lapide#scripture-Ezra:37:25">xxxvii. 25</a>, &amp;c.<br /><br />The first promise
which was made to David concerning Christ, that He should spring from him, and reign for ever, is
found <a href="/2_Samuel:7:12-lapide">2 Sam. vii. 12</a>; the same was confirmed,
<a href="/Psalms:88-lapide">Ps. lxxxviii</a>. and <a href="/Psalms:131-lapide">cxxxi.</a>; and
repeated to Solomon, David’s Son,
<a href="/1_Kings:9-lapide#scripture-1_Kings:9:5">1 Kings ix. 5</a>. When, therefore, S. Matthew
says, <i>Jesus Christ the Son of David</i>, he means that all these promises were now fulfilled in
Christ. Thus S. Chrysostom 2; Theophilus, Euthym.; Irenæus, lib. 8, c. 8; S. Ambrose, lib. 3
<i>in Luc</i>., c. 3; and others.<br /><br />
<i>Son of Abraham</i>. The word Son here may be referred either to David or to Christ. For David, as
well as Christ, was a son, <i>i.e</i>. a descendant, of Abraham. It signifies, therefore, that
Christ, through David His father, was also the Son of Abraham, who was the father of them that
believe, and of the ancient Church. The first express promise concerning Christ was made to him. (<a
	href="/Genesis:22-lapide#scripture-Genesis:22:18">Gen. xxii. 18.</a>) Now, from the birth of Abraham to the birth of
Christ there were 2,000 years; from the death of
David to Christ, 1,013 years. So great was the antiquity of the oracles and promises of God
concerning Christ; so constant and sure was God’s faithfulness in fulfilling them. And this is why
S. Matthew so carefully derives the genealogy of Christ from Abraham, even through forty-two
generations, in order that he might show the Jews that Jesus Christ was the true Messiah promised to
Abraham, and that He was the Son of Abraham and the rest of the patriarchs; and that He might
therefore, as such, be received, cherished, and worshipped by the Jews.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Abraham begat Isaac</i>. These two, with those who came after them, were the first patriarchs,
the founders of the synagogue and people of God, and of the Kingdom of Christ. They, as types,
foreshadowed Him. (See comment on Genesis, where I have unfolded their genealogies.) I will not here
repeat what has been said. God constantly calls Himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and
even makes a boast, so to say, of this title. Wherefore He chose the posterity of Abraham,
descending through Isaac and Jacob, for His own family and Church, and gave them the sign and pledge
of circumcision. Wherefore God changed Abraham’s name from Abram, <i>i.e</i>., a high father, to
Abraham, that is to say, אב רב המזן, <i>ab rab hamon</i>, or the father of a great multitude—viz.,
of the believing people that should be born of him according to the flesh; in like manner as of
Christ, both Jews and Gentiles, who believe in Him, are born according to the Spirit. Now
Isaac—<i>i.e</i>. laughter—about to be offered up by his father on Mount Moriah, clearly represented
Christ, who was crucified on the same mount, and brought salvation and joy to the whole world.<br />
<br />
<!---->
<i>And Judah begat Pharez and Zara of Thamar</i>. (See what I have said on Tamar,
<a href="/Genesis:38-lapide#scripture-Genesis:38:29">Gen. xxxviii. 29.</a>)<br /><br />
Observe that in the genealogy of Christ, with the exception of His Blessed Mother, only four females
are made mention of, three of them harlots—Thamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba—and the fourth a Gentile,
Ruth the Moabitess. Rahab, too, was a Gentile, being an inhabitant of Jericho. If the reason of all
this be asked, SS. Jerome, Chrysostom, Ambrose answer, that it was so because Christ would signify
that “He who came for the abolishing and putting away of sins wished to be born of sinners.” This
reason is true, but allegorical. The literal and simple reason is, that these women were united to
their husbands, not in the ordinary way, but after a new and extraordinary manner; and so they
became types of the Church of Christ, which, when the Jews were rejected, was gathered out of the
Gentiles by a new vocation, and after a new manner. Tamar, because Shelah was denied her in
marriage, or rather because her union with him was deferred, using deceit, prostituted herself to
Judah. Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, was united to David, first by adultery, then in marriage. Rahab
married Salmon because she hospitably received and protected the Hebrew spies who were sent by
Joshua to Jericho, and so she became of the same faith and religion. Ruth married Boaz when she had
passed with her mother-in-law, Naomi, from Moab into Judæa.<br /><br />
The tropological sense is to show us the vanity of pride of birth, and that true nobility consists,
not in ancestry, but in our own good disposition and virtues. Thus S. Chrysostom. Wherefore let no
one be ashamed of his birth, nor even of vile and wicked ancestors; but let us say with Cicero, “I
have outshone my forefathers in virtue.” There can be no doubt that there are in the ancestry of the
most exalted persons, forasmuch as they are sprung from Adam, many ignoble, worthless, wicked, and
infamous persons. Plato, according to Seneca (<i>Epis</i>. 44), is of opinion that all kings are
descended from servants, and that all servants are sprung from kings; that there is no king who has
been entirely free from the plough, and no ploughman who has not been mixed up with kings.<br /><br />
Lastly, Solomon, amongst the other vanities and uncertainties of the world, reckons this: “Because
out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a kingdom: and another born king is
consumed with poverty.” (<a href="/Ecclesiastes:4-lapide#scripture-Ecclesiastes:4:14">Eccles. iv. 14.</a>) <br /><br />

<i>Aminadab</i>. He was prince of the tribe of Judah when the Israelites came out of Egypt, who,
when the rest stood still, fearing to go into the Red Sea, although God had made dry ground through
the midst of it, courageously entered into it, and brought his own tribe safely through, and then
the other princes and tribes followed. This is a Hebrew tradition. To this alludes the verse,
<a href="/Song_of_Songs:6-lapide#scripture-Song_of_Songs:6:12">Cant. vi. 12</a>, “My soul made me
like the chariots of Aminadab.” His son Naasson succeeded him in the headship of the tribe.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Jesse</i>, or, according to a different punctuation of the Hebrew, <i>Isai</i>. The name itself
prefigured Jesus Christ, who was to be born of him. For Jesse and Jesus are the same word if we
consider the root of both, which is to be found in the Hebrew ישצ <i>iasca, i.e</i>., to save.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Of her which had been the wife of Urias</i>. After Uriah’s death, David married his wife, and of
her he begat Solomon, for Solomon was not born of adultery, but in wedlock. In this passage it is
intimated that God did not recall the promises which He had made to David on account of his adultery
with Bathsheba, but, on their repentance, He confirmed His promises. Whence from Bathsheba and her
son Solomon Christ was descended. In truth, Bathsheba herself became a saintly penitent, and brought
up Solomon her son in a holy manner. Yea, she became illustrious for the spirit of prophecy, as I
have shown in <a href="/Proverbs:31-lapide#scripture-Proverbs:31:1">Prov. xxxi. 1</a>, on the words,
“The words of king Lemuel. The vision which his mother taught him.” (Vulgate.)<br /><br />

<!---->
<i>Now Joram begat Ozias</i>—not directly, but with three generations intervening; for Joram was
really the father of Ahaziah, Ahaziah of Joash, Joash of Amaziah, Amaziah of Azariah or Uzziah, for
he had both names. (See
<a href="/1_Chronicles:3-lapide#scripture-1_Chronicles:3:12">1 Chron. iii. 12</a>, &amp;c.)<br /><br />
It is asked why S. Matthew here omits these three links in the genealogy. S. Jerome answers, because
the Evangelist wished to form three exact series of fourteen generations each, on which see
<a href="#scripture-Matthew:1:17">ver. 17.</a> And because Jehoram had allied himself to the most
wicked Jezebel and to Ahab, in taking Ahab’s sister, the impious Athaliah, to wife; for God had
sworn that, on account of Ahab’s impiety and idolatry, He would blot out all his posterity. (<a
	href="/1_Kings:21-lapide#scripture-1_Kings:21:21">1 Kings xxi. 21</a>, &amp;c.) Posterity in Scripture is reckoned
to the fourth generation. Here, then, it is blotted
out, forasmuch as it is omitted and obliterated by S. Matthew. Thus S. Hilary, S. Thomas, Jansen,
&amp;c. Gaspar Sanchez gives another reason. He conjectures that Matthew actually wrote as follows:
“Joram begat Ochoziah, Ochoziah begat Joash, Joash begat Amaziah, Amaziah begat Oziah;” but that the
copyist, misled by the similarity between Ochoziah and Oziah, as the names are written in Greek, by
a slip of his eye passed over from Ahaziah to Uzziah. Thus Gaspar. But this would be an enormous
blunder, and though one copyist might fall into such an error, it was scarcely possible that all
could. All extant MSS. and Versions are alike here—Greek, Syriac, Latin, Arabic, &amp;c. “<i>Joram begat Ozias</i>,” not
<i>Ahaziah</i>. Besides, if these three generations were inserted, they would make seventeen
generations, whereas S. Matthew says expressly there were fourteen generations. <br /><br />

<i>Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren</i>. Josias begat four sons. The first was Johanan; the
second, Jehoiakim, who is also Eliakim; the third, Jehoahaz, also called Shallum; the fourth,
Zedekiah, who is also Mattaniah. Jehoahaz, although the third son, succeeded his father Josias
immediately upon his death; but Pharaoh, King of Egypt, removed him, and placed his brother
Jehoiakim upon the throne. After he had reigned eleven years, Nebuchadnezzar slew him, and gave the
crown to his son Jehoiachin. Him he shortly afterwards dethroned, and made his uncle Zedekiah king.
When Zedekiah rebelled, he took him captive, and put out his eyes; and in him that branch of David’s
royal line came to an end.<br /><br />
<i>The carrying away to Babylon</i>—Greek <i>ε̉πὶ τής μετοικεσίας Βαβυλώνος</i>—that is, about the
time of the transmigration to Babylon, or the Babylonish captivity, in which the Jews were carried
away by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon.<br /><br />
The transmigration of the Jews to Babylon took place at three different times. The first was in the
eleventh year of King Jehoiakim, when Daniel and Ezekiel were carried away. The second was three
months afterwards, when Mordecai, Esther’s uncle, was carried away, together with Jehoiachin, the
son of Jehoiakim. The third, and most complete, captivity was eleven years afterwards, under King
Zedekiah, when almost all the people who were left were taken away.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Jeconias begat Salathiel</i>. There is a great difficulty here, which Porphyry, the enemy of
Christ and of Christians, was in the habit of bringing forward as insuperable. For this Jeconias,
the father of Salathiel, was not the Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, who is spoken of in the preceding
verse, but the son of that Jehoiakim, and the grandson of Josiah, and consequently there are only
thirteen generations, instead of fourteen, as S. Matthew enumerates.<br /><br />
S. Jerome replies that this Jeconias is a different person from Jeconias, the son of Josiah. The
former was Jehoiakim, or <i>Jechonias</i>, and <i>Jeconias</i> by a corruption. The latter is
properly Jehoiachin. Josiah begat Jehoiakim, and Jehoiakim begat Jehoiachin. One generation must,
therefore, be supplied in this place. “<i>Now Jeconias begat Jechonias</i>,” as some Greek and Latin
MSS. do read. That what has been said is correct, is clear from
<a href="/1_Chronicles:3-lapide#scripture-1_Chronicles:3:15">1 Chron. iii. 15, 16</a>, and
<a href="/2_Kings:23-lapide">2 Kings xxiii.</a> and <a href="/2_Kings:24-lapide">xxiv.</a><br /><br />
The generation in question was omitted, either by S. Matthew himself, in order to avoid the
repetition of the two similar names, as S. Augustine thinks, or, more probably, through the fault
and ignorance of transcribers, who, mistaking <i>Jechonias</i> for <i>Jeconias</i>, thought that one
of the two was redundant, and so omitted it. This was the opinion of S. Epiphanius.<br /><br />

<i>Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary</i>. You may ask, why is the generation of Christ here
derived from the genealogy of Joseph? Christ was the Son, not of Joseph, but of the Virgin Mary,
especially if S. Mary were able, as it might appear, to marry a man of another tribe, as her cousin
Elizabeth, who was of the tribe of Judah, like Mary herself, married Zachariah, a priest, and
therefore of the tribe of Levi.<br /><br />
The answer is, that Jewish women might, indeed, marry into another tribe: but if they themselves, in
the failure of heirs male, became heiresses of their fathers, they were in that case obliged to
marry husbands of their own tribe and family, that their inheritance might not pass by marriage into
another tribe. (See the last chapter of
<a href="/Numbers:36-lapide#scripture-Numbers:36:7">Numbers, ver. 7.</a>)<br /><br />
Joakim, the father of the Blessed Virgin, had no male children, a fact which S. Matthew here omits,
as something perfectly well known in the age in which he writes. Hence it became the duty of S. Mary
to marry a husband of her own tribe and family, that is to say, Joseph. Thus the genealogy of Joseph
became the genealogy of the Blessed Virgin, and consequently of Christ, the Lord. Thus, too, it is,
that the Fathers teach universally that Joseph and Mary were of the same tribe and family.<br /><br />
It may be yet further asked, why S. Matthew unfolded the genealogy of Joseph rather than of Mary,
since Christ was born of her alone, being a Virgin? I answer:—First, because among the Jews, and
other nations, genealogy is customarily reckoned through fathers and husbands, not through mothers
and wives. Second, because Joseph was the true and lawful father of Christ, after the manner which I
shall explain presently. And Christ was the heir of David’s throne and sceptre, not through Mary,
but through Joseph, according to God’s promise to David,
<a href="/2_Samuel:7-lapide#scripture-2_Samuel:7:12">2 Sam. vii. 12</a>;
<a href="/Psalms:88-lapide">Ps. lxxxviii.</a> and <a href="/Psalms:131-lapide">cxxxi.</a> The
sceptre, therefore, of Judah devolved upon Jesus Christ, not only by the promise and gift of God,
but by the right of hereditary succession. For if, by common right, sons succeed to their fathers’
inheritance, when they are only accounted their sons by common repute, how much more was Christ
Joseph’s, His father’s, heir, since He was the Son of his wife, by the power and the gift of the
Holy Ghost? Wherefore as Joseph had a parent’s right over Christ, indeed, all rights which parents
have over sons, so on the other hand, Christ had, with reference to Joseph, all the rights which
sons have in respect to their parents. He had therefore a right to the kingdom of Israel after
Joseph’s death. Hence the question of the Magi
<a href="/Matthew:2-lapide#scripture-Matthew:2:2">(ii. 2)</a>, &#8220;Where is he that is born King
of the Jews?&#8221; This was what S. Matthew wished to demonstrate, who, as S. Augustine says,
insists, most of all the Evangelists, upon the kingship of Christ. And this explains why he gives
the genealogy of Joseph, rather than of Mary. For she could not be the heiress of the kingdom, so
long as heirs male, like Joseph and others, survived. Whence also it must be said, as a consequence,
that the father and other ancestors of Joseph were first-born, or at least eldest surviving sons of
their fathers, so that the right of reigning devolved upon them.<br /><br />
This is what is meant in the <a href="/Luke:1-lapide">first chapter of S. Luke</a> by the words,
&#8220;And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father.&#8221; So likewise in
<a href="/Genesis:49-lapide#scripture-Genesis:49:10">Gen. xlix. 10</a>, &#8220;The sceptre shall not
be taken away from Judah, nor a ruler from his thigh, till he come that is to be sent:&#8221; that
is, Christ, who was to restore to Judah the sceptre, iniquitously taken away by Herod; yea, who was
to raise their kingdom to a far higher grandeur, by making it spiritual instead of corporeal,
heavenly instead of earthly, and, instead of temporal, eternal.<br /><br />
Observe the expression, <i>Joseph the husband of Mary</i>. The Arabic has—<i>the spouse of Mary</i>.
From this we may gather that S. Joseph had all the rights of a real husband with regard to the
Virgin, and consequently is rightly and truly called the father of Christ. This is pointed out by S.
Augustine.<br /><br />
1. Christ may be said to be the fruit of the marriage of Joseph and Mary, because He was born
<i>in</i> wedlock, though not <i>of</i> wedlock. He may therefore be ascribed either to His father
or His mother.<br /><br />
2. Forasmuch as a man and his wife are made one by marriage, as it were but one person in the eye of
the law, therefore they have everything in common, and so all their legitimate children: for I
except children born of adultery. They have the adulterer as their father, and belong to him.<br /><br />
Christ, then, who was the Son of the Virgin Mother of God, was also the Son of Joseph, who was her
husband, and therefore the partner of all her honours and blessings.<br /><br />
Joseph was more truly the father of Christ than one who adopts a son is the father of that son. He
is only a father by adoption, but Joseph was father of Christ by marriage. Hence it follows that
Joseph had a father’s authority over Christ, and therefore the utmost solicitude and affection for
him. And Christ in return cherished, loved, and honoured Joseph as a father, and was obedient to
him, as is plain from <a href="/Luke:2#scripture-Luke:2:51">Luke ii. 51.</a> &#8220;This
subjection,&#8221; as Gerson says, &#8220;marks at once the unspeakable humility of Christ, and the
incomparable dignity of Joseph and Mary.&#8221;<br /><br />
3. Because Christ properly belonged to the family of Joseph: for He belonged to His mother’s family
as His mother herself belonged to Joseph’s. There was therefore upon earth one most noble, yea,
divine and heavenly family, of which the father and ruler was Joseph; the mother, the Blessed
Virgin; the son, Christ. In it were the three most exalted and excellent persons of the whole world;
first, Christ, both God and man; secondly, the Virgin Mother of God, most closely united to Christ;
and thirdly, Joseph, the father of Christ by marriage.<br /><br />
The common herd of men, yea, many of this world’s wise ones, think of Joseph only as a poor and
despised carpenter. But the more despised and unknown he was upon earth, so much the greater is his
glory in heaven. Wherefore Gregory XV. hath lately decreed that his Festival shall be celebrated as
a <i>Double</i> by the whole Church on the 19th of March. And this is a well deserved honour; for
consider, from what I am about to subjoin, how great were his prerogatives, his office, and dignity
above all other men.<br /><br />
1. Joseph was the husband of the Blessed Virgin, and the father of Christ, as I have already shown.
He was therefore the head and superior both of the Virgin, and of Christ as He was man. Hence,<br /><br />
2. There was singular love and reverence, on the part both of the Blessed Virgin and of Christ,
towards Joseph. Whence John Gerson, Chancellor of Paris (<i>Serm. de Nativ. B.V.M</i>.), exclaims,
&#8220;O, altogether wonderful is thy exaltation, O Joseph, incomparable thy dignity, that the
Mother of God, the Queen of Heaven, the lady of the world, should not disdain to call thee
lord!&#8221; S. Gregory Nazianzen (<i>Orat</i>. 11), denotes and celebrates the excellence of the
husband of his sister, Gorgonia, by this one title, that he was Gorgonia’s husband. &#8220;Do you
wish,&#8221; he says, &#8220;that I should describe the man? He was her husband, and I know of
nothing more that I need say.&#8221; You may say the same of S. Joseph. Do you desire to know who
and how great he was? He was the husband of the Mother of God.<br /><br />
3. The ministry and office of Joseph was most noble, in that it pertains to the order of the
hypostatic union of the Word with our flesh. For Joseph exercised all his labours and actions in
immediate proximity to the Person of Christ. He nourished, cherished, and guarded Christ, and taught
Him his art as a carpenter, according to the common opinion of the Doctors. Hear Franc. Suarez (3
<i>part. qu&aelig;st</i>. 29, <i>disp</i>. 8, <i>sect</i>. 1):—&#8220;There are some offices which
pertain directly to the order of grace making grateful, and in this the Apostles hold the highest
rank, and therefore need greater assistance of grace than all others. There are, again, other
offices which pertain to the order of the hypostatic union, which is <i>in genere</i> a higher
order, as is plain from the motherhood of God in the Blessed Virgin. And in this order S. Joseph
exercised his ministry.&#8221;<br /><br />
4. Joseph, by his familiar and constant companionship with Christ and the Blessed Virgin, was made a
sharer in their divine secrets, and daily beheld and imitated their lofty virtues.<br /><br />
5. Joseph was a person of the utmost sanctity, and endowed by God with singular gifts, both of
nature and grace, so that in that age there was no man more holy, or more worthy the betrothal of
the Mother of God. Whence Suarez thinks it probable that Joseph was superior to the Apostles and
John the Baptist in grace and glory, because his office was more excellent than theirs; for it is
more to be the father and governor of Christ than His preacher and forerunner. He adds that when
Joseph espoused the Blessed Virgin, he was of mature age, and died before the Crucifixion. This is
why in the Passion of Christ no mention is made of Joseph. Lastly, he rose with Christ in common
with the rest of the patriarchs, of whom mention is made in
<a href="/Matthew:27-lapide#scripture-Matthew:27:52">Matt. xxvii. 52</a>—&#8220;Many bodies of the
saints which slept arose.&#8221; These are the things in which Joseph was pre-eminent.<br /><br />
<i>Of whom was born Jesus</i>. The form of expression is here changed The Evangelist does not say,
<i>Joseph begat Jesus</i>, as he had said of Abraham and the rest. Neither does he say,
<i>Mary begat Jesus</i>, but of whom was born Jesus. By this expression he signifies—1. That Jesus
was born of Mary, not by natural means, but by supernatural—that is to say, by the operation of the
Holy Ghost. 2. That Jesus was not sprung from His father Joseph, but born of His mother alone, she
being a virgin, and therefore that Joseph had no other connection with the genealogy of Christ than
by right of his wife, the Virgin Mary.<br /><br />
Well does S. Bernard say (<i>Hom</i>. 1 <i>super Missus est</i>)—&#8220;Very beautiful was the
mingling of humility and virginity; nor is that soul in only a slight degree pleasing unto God, in
which humility commends virginity, and virginity adorns humility; but of what veneration must she be
worthy whose fruitfulness exalteth humility, and childbirth consecrates virginity?&#8221; And
again—&#8220;Such a nativity became God, that He should not be born save of a Virgin: such a birth
became a Virgin, that she should bring forth only God.&#8221; It was fitting that, as Christ had a
Father in heaven, He should have no father upon earth, but only a mother; for He who was without a
mother in heaven (Gr. <i>&#945;&#777;&#956;&#942;&#964;&#969;&#961;</i>) was without a father on
earth (Gr. <i>&#945;&#777;&#960;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#961;</i>). For it behoved that the Conception
and the Birth of Christ should be removed as far as possible from original sin—that as it was not
right that He should contract it, so neither should it be possible. And in this He was superior to
His mother; for she, although conceived without sin by the singular preservation of God,
nevertheless was bound, through that natural conception of herself whereby she was born of Joachim
and Anna by natural generation from Adam, to have contracted it, unless it had been prevented by the
grace of God. Lastly, it behoved that the Birth of Christ should be most divinely pure, that it
might powerfully commend virginity and chastity to us. Whence S. Gregory Nazianzen (<i>Orat</i>. 38,
<i>de Nativ. in principio</i>) says, &#8220;Christ was born of a virgin: O ye women, do ye then
cherish virginity, that ye may be able to be mothers of Christ.&#8221; And Cyril of Jerusalem says,
&#8220;Christ was born that He might make virgins; much more, therefore, ought a virgin to keep
chaste her body.&#8221;<br /><br />
The expression—<i>Of whom was born Jesus</i>—signifies that the Virgin was the real mother of
Jesus—<i>i.e</i>., of that Man who, being hypostatically united with God, was both God and man.
Therefore was she truly the mother of God. For although she was not the mother of Deity, yet did she
give birth to God, because she was mother of that Man. For that Man was God, therefore the Blessed
Virgin was mother of God.<br /><br />
The reason, <i>&agrave; priori</i>, is identity of Person, because there is but one Person, and that
a Divine Person, in Christ. Hence the attributes of either nature can be predicated of Him; and
there becomes a joint participation of the peculiarities of each; so that this Man may be called
God, and in return, God may be called Man, the Son of the Virgin, and it can be said that God
suffered and was crucified, &amp;c. For one Person is presupposed in these expressions, who
gathereth up into Himself all the actions and passions of both natures. Wherefore the Person of the
Son of God, who is God, is rightly spoken of as born of the Virgin Mary, but according to His human,
not His divine nature.<br /><br />
The surpassing dignity, therefore, of the Blessed Virgin is here indicated: for such is the
motherhood of God, that from her He received His own, that is to say, His human substances, such as
flesh, bones, blood; and received it in such sort that He cherished, loved, and reverenced her as
His mother, and was obedient to her as a mother, and spoke of her as &#8220;mother.&#8221; Whence S.
Bernard exclaims in admiration, &#8220;A twofold wonder, a twofold miracle; God obeys a
woman—humility without a parallel; and a woman is the head of God—dignity beyond compare!&#8221;<br /><br />
The Virgin Mother of God possessed the same right and authority over Christ which other mothers have
over their own sons. Yea, she had more than other mothers have, because she was more the mother of
Christ than other women are mothers of their sons, for a reason which I shall adduce presently.<br /><br />
S. Thomas (I <i>part. qu&aelig;st</i>. 25, <i>art</i>. 6) teaches that God could not perform a
greater work than the Incarnation of the Word, and the maternity of the Blessed Virgin, because she
is the very Mother of God—God than whom nothing greater can be imagined. Hence Bede saith, &#8220;O
most blessed Virgin, in thee alone that rich, yea, more than rich, King emptied Himself.&#8221; For
to be Mother of God is the highest affinity, consanguinity, and union with God. By that motherhood
the Blessed Virgin Mary is in as close relationship with God as a mother is with her son.<br /><br />
From this dignity of Mother of God, there follow all the gifts and privileges which have been
granted to the Blessed Virgin by God above all men and angels. For as the Humanity of Christ, being
united to the Word, receiveth from the Word such gifts and privileges as are becoming to such a
union—I mean such as may exalt that Humanity, and render It, as it were, worthy of union with the
Word so, in like manner, God showered upon Mary all the gifts and graces which befitted such a
Mother of Christ and Spouse of God. Whence you may draw this conclusion—Mary is the Mother of God,
therefore she is far more excellent than all the angels, even the Cherubim and Seraphim. She is the
Mother of God, therefore she is Queen and Lady of heaven and earth. She is the Mother of God,
therefore whatsoever privilege has been granted to any of the Saints, that she obtains in a more
excellent degree.<br /><br />
3. <i>Of whom was born Jesus</i>, signifies that He was born of His Mother only, so that she alone
contributed to Christ all that flesh and substance which other fathers and mothers are wont to
contribute conjointly to their children. For sons derive a portion of their substance from their
fathers, a portion from their mothers. Wherefore the Blessed Virgin contributed more to Christ than
other mothers are wont to contribute to their sons, because she alone was, in a manner, both father
and mother of Christ.<br /><br />
Hence it follows—1. That the Blessed Virgin hath more right in Christ than other mothers have in
their sons. 2. That Mary had far greater love for Christ, and Christ for her, than other mothers
have for their sons, and other sons for their mothers, both because she alone bare (<i>genuit</i>)
Him, as well as because she bare Him not after the natural, but after the supernatural and divine
order. So, too, the love which, in other sons, is divided between father and mother, in Christ was
united, and applied wholly to His Mother. And thus she felt, as it were, with a duplicated grief the
pains of Christ upon the Cross, and experienced a duplicated joy at His Resurrection.<br /><br />
4. The expression, <i>of whom was born</i>, signifies that the Holy Ghost was the most potent and
efficient cause of the Nativity of Christ, who, within the Blessed Virgin, of her most pure blood,
formed the Body of Christ, organized It, and gave It life, and hypostatically united It to the Word
in the first moment of Its conception. Still the Blessed Virgin was a secondary cause, and a true
Mother of Christ for the purpose of generation, not merely as passively furnishing the material, but
as actively concurring therein by way of forming, disposing, and organizing that material. See
Francis Suarez, 3 <i>p</i>., <i>q</i>. 3, 2 <i>art</i>., 4 <i>ac</i>., <i>q</i>. 33, <i>art</i>. 4,
where he teaches that Christ’s generation of the Virgin was supernatural, as far as its manner and
swiftness were concerned, because, in one moment, it was perfected by the Holy Ghost as the
efficient cause. And so the action whereby Mary became a mother was natural; the mode was
supernatural.<br /><br />
<i>Was born Jesus</i>. The Word was made Flesh. God became Man. The Son of God was made the Son of
the Virgin. This, as S. Thomas teaches at length, was the highest and greatest of all the works of
God. At this work the Angels and all the Saints have ever been and are amazed in wonder. For in It
God manifested His highest power by uniting man to God, clay to the Word, earth to heaven. He
manifested also the highest wisdom, that He, who in His Godhead might not suffer to redeem us, put
on, in the Virgin’s womb, flesh, whereby He might be able to suffer, and to make satisfaction to the
Father for our sins. He manifested also the highest justice, because by reason of the dignity of His
Person, He makes satisfaction upon equal terms, as it were, to the wrath and justice of God, by
suffering death upon the Cross. And He manifested the utmost goodness, because He emptied Himself,
that He might replenish us with His gifts. He was made the Son of man that He might make us sons of
God, as S. Augustine says. He was born on earth, that man might be born in heaven, as S. Gregory
says.<br /><br />
<i>Who is called Christ</i>: that is, who is the Messiah, or the Christ, the Redeemer of the world,
promised to the Fathers. And henceforth He can and ought to be called Messiah, or Christ in His own
right, and therefore now He is verily so called by all the faithful.<br /><br />
How this genealogy of S. Matthew is reconcilable with that of S. Luke, I will unfold in my
commentary on the <a href="/Luke:3-lapide">third chapter of S. Luke.</a><br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David, are fourteen generations. And from David to
	the transmigration</i>
(the Syriac has <i>exile</i>)
<i>of Babylon are fourteen generations: and from the transmigration of Babylon to Christ are
	fourteen generations</i>. From Abraham, therefore, unto Christ are forty-two generations.
<a href="/Luke:3-lapide">S. Luke (chap. iii.)</a> enumerates seventy-seven generations, but he
places no stress upon the number as S. Matthew does. Though S. Augustine, c. 2,
<i>de consensu Evang</i>., c. 4., is of opinion that entire remission and abolition of all sins,
which is effected through Christ, is denoted by the seventy-seven generations. Whence Christ
commanded that forgiveness should be extended to an erring brother seventy times seven. (<a
	href="/Matthew:28-lapide#scripture-Matthew:28:22">Matt. xviii. 22.</a>)<br /><br />
By generations, you must understand all the persons, both those begetting and those begotten. These
are the fourteen. For the Greek is not <i>&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</i>,
<i>i.e. generation</i>, properly called, but <i>&#947;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#945;</i>,
<i>i.e. offspring, race, family, and children, the duration of the life of one man</i>. For the
generations, exactly numbered, are only thirteen in the first Tesseradecade, as you will see if you
count the recurrence of the word &#8220;begat;&#8221; which word is repeated thirteen times; because
in it alone Abraham is reckoned the first, and David the last generation. But in the second
Tesseradecade, David, the first in it, is not reckoned; nor yet in the third, Jeconias the first
name; because those persons have been already named and enumerated as the last in the second and
third Tesseradecades. Therefore, in the third Tesseradecade, one generation must be added—namely,
Jehoiakim begat Jehoiachin—in order that it may consist of fourteen generations; that is to say, of
fourteen persons begetting and begotten, as I have already said. All the generations then are
precisely forty-one; but the persons begetting and begotten are forty-two, because the generation of
the first—namely, Abraham—is not reckoned here, but is presupposed as being known from the Book of
Genesis.<br /><br />
You may ask, with what object S. Matthew so accurately enumerates these three Tesseradecades of
generations? The answer is, because he wishes to pass in review the threefold condition of the
Jewish people—the first, the <i>quasi</i> democratic state under the several Patriarchs and Judges,
such as Othniel, Gideon, Samson, Eli, Samuel, &amp;c., who presided over Israel from Abraham to
David; the second, the monarchical, under kings, as David and his descendants, until the captivity;
the third, the aristocratic, under dukes and pontiffs, as Judas, Jonathan, Simon, and the rest of
the Maccabees, from the Babylonish captivity unto Christ. Matthew signifies that this threefold
condition and government of the people was thrice changed, and must be a fourth time changed by
Christ, and ended in Christ, who brought in an eternal kingdom. Thus the Fathers and commentators
<i>passim</i>.<br /><br />
Whence Nazianzen, in his poem on the genealogy of Christ says:—<br /><br />
<blockquote>Thus he deduced a royal race, and kingly sceptre.</blockquote>
Maldonatus adds a medical analogy. In fevers, and other diseases, physicians call the fourteenth the
critical day, and the most perilous. Agreeably, therefore, to the nature of man, after each period
of fourteen generations, God seems to have wished to change the condition of His people, that one
form of government, as it were, growing sick and failing, a better one might be born and succeed it,
until, through Christ, the best of all should be substituted, which should heal and correct the
defects and weakness of the three preceding, and establish the kingdom of the Church, flourishing,
sound, and eternal.<br /><br />
Lastly, Matthew enumerates forty-two generations by three Tesseradecades, so as to make it a
probable conjecture in the mind of his reader, that it was fitting that Christ should come after
this exact number of generations. For as there were fourteen generations before the kingdom of the
Jews was established, fourteen during its continuance, after which, during fourteen generations, it
evidently declined, so, by a probable conjecture, it might be supposed, that after these last
fourteen generations, the kingdom fading away, it was to be restored to a better state by Messiah.
For as there were fourteen generations before, and fourteen in the kingdom, so there were as many
after the kingdom of Israel until Christ. Again, before the kingdom the promise of Christ was made
to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; in the kingdom to David and Solomon; after the kingdom the same
promise was repeated to Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, &amp;c., that there might be a feeling that all
the promises made concerning Christ, both before, during, and after the kingdom were ended and
fulfilled in Christ.<br /><br />
Abraham begins, David ends the first Tesseradecade; Solomon begins, Jehoiakim or Jehoiachin ends the
second; Jehoiakim or Jehoiachin begins, Christ ends the third. And He is the end of the law, and the
deliverer of the captive people and the captive world. So Francisc. Lucas. For the Jews knew from
the decline and failure of their commonwealth, and especially when the sceptre was taken away from
Judah by Herod, according to the prophecy of Jacob, Genesis xlix. 10, that the Advent of Messiah
might certainly be expected. Whence their kingdom being broken up, and this sceptre transferred, S.
Matthew here teaches that Messiah was now come, and was none other than Jesus Christ. And thus he
would persuade the Jews to believe in Him. <i>Symbolically</i>, Origen (<i>Hom</i>. 27
<i>in Num</i>.) and S. Jerome (<i>Epist. ad Fabiolam de</i> 42 <i>Mansion</i>.), remark, that those
forty-two generations correspond to the forty-two stations of the Israelites in the wilderness, by
which they arrived at the land of Canaan promised to Abraham. Similarly, through the forty-two
generations we arrive at the Messiah, or the Christ, promised to the same Abraham, and through
Christ, at the land of the living, promised to the saints in heaven.<br /><br />
Again, the number fourteen, because it contains twice seven, by which the sevenfold grace of the
Holy Ghost is signified, denotes the gift of the same Holy Spirit in two-fold abundance to man, as
it was in Christ, who, indeed, by a like symbol, having suffered on the fourteenth day of the month
Nisan, when the moon was full, redeemed us by His death, and merited abundance of graces for us.
Wherefore the Psalmist sings concerning Him, <a href="/Psalms:71-lapide">Ps. lxxi.</a>: &#8220;In
his days shall the righteous flourish, yea and abundance of peace, so long as the moon
endureth.&#8221; Listen to S. Ambrose, <i>Oration on the death of Theodosius</i>: &#8220;In the
number fourteen we have received man’s perfection; whence the Lord’s Passover received the form of
its celebration, on the fourteenth day of the moon. Wherefore he who celebrates the Passover ought
to be perfect, ought to love the Lord Jesus, who, loving His own people with a perfect love, offered
Himself to His Passion. A notable mystery is in the number, since the Father delivered up his only
Son for us all, when the moon was shining with a full orb of light. For like this is the Church,
which piously celebrates the Passover of our Lord Jesus Christ. It abideth for ever, like the moon
at the full. Whosoever shall well celebrate here the Lord’s Passover, shall be in light,
everlastingly.&#8221;<br /><br />
<i>Anagogically</i>, the number forty-two is composed of six into seven, For six times seven makes
forty-two. The six denotes the labours of this life, whereby we come to the seven, or the sabbath of
rest and eternal felicity. For in the six first days of the world God made all things in heaven and
earth; but in the seventh day, or the sabbath, He rested from all His work.<br /><br />
<i>Tropologically</i>, by this forty-fold number of generations is signified the life of the body,
as compounded of the four elements. For this life standeth in keeping the ten commandments of God,
which are perfected by the four Gospels. For ten into four makes forty. So Salmeron, so even S.
Augustine, and from him Peter Bongus, <i>On the Mysteries of Numbers, Num. XIV</i>.: &#8220;The
three divisions,&#8221; he says, &#8220;in the generation of Christ, hint at the doctrine of the
Holy Trinity, which is laid down concordantly by the Law and the Gospel. For three signifies faith
in the Trinity, four the evangelical doctrine, ten the institution of the Law.&#8221; The same
author adds shortly afterwards: &#8220;That the number fourteen should be thrice repeated signifies
true religion. For four and ten indicate the New and Old Testament. For the way to Christ is
preached through the Ten Commandments of the Law, and the four Gospels; so, however, that we should
consecrate whatever is ascribed to the Trinity, that is, to God, because no commandment is fulfilled
unless this number is preserved in the worship of God. By the type of this number, moreover, Ezekiel
(<a href="/Ezekiel:15-lapide">chap. xl.</a>) beheld in the fourteenth year after the smiting of the
city, a new city, even the Church, which Christ, born and dying, founded in the fourteenth
generation after the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldees, as Cassiodorus remarks (<i>in <a
		href="/Psalms:14-lapide">Ps. xiv.,</a> sub finem</i>). Lastly, in the forty second year after Christ’s Passion,
Jerusalem was utterly destroyed by
Titus and Vespasian to avenge His death—as S. Jerome observes on the words of the Psalm: &#8220;In
the next generation let his name be clean put out.&#8221;<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Now the generation of Christ was in this wise</i>. The Birth of Christ happened in this manner.
For <i>Birth</i>, the Greek has not <i>&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</i>,
<i>i.e., generation</i>, properly so called, but
<i>&#947;&#941;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</i>,
<i>i.e., rise, conception, generation, nativity</i>. When any one arises he is conceived, is
begotten, is born.<br /><br />
<i>When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with
	child, of the Holy Ghost</i>. Syriac, &#8220;<i>of the Spirit of holiness</i>&#8221;—that is, the Spirit who is
holy, and the
Author and Fountain of all holiness.<br /><br />
God willed the Blessed Virgin to be betrothed to Joseph—1. Because Joseph appears to have been the
nearest heir of David’s kingdom, that it might devolve from him upon Christ, as from a father to a
son, by due order and right of succession, as I have said,
<a href="#scripture-Matthew:1:16">ver. 16</a>. 2. Because Joseph was a most holy man, like unto the
patriarch Joseph, of whose chastity and virtue he partook, as well as of his name. He was called
Joseph—<i>i.e</i>., <i>increased</i>—for he was enriched with great gifts and graces from God. Thus
S. Bernard, <i>Hom</i>. 2 <i>super Missus est</i>. <br /><br />
You may ask whether it be here meant that the Blessed Virgin was espoused to Joseph only by
betrothal, or by an actual marriage contract and celebration of nuptials; and so, whether Christ was
incarnate, and conceived of a virgin who was betrothed only, or of one who was actually married? For
to a virgin thus betrothed Gabriel was sent to announce the Incarnation of Christ. (<a
	href="/Luke:1-lapide#scripture-Luke:1:38">Luke i. 38.</a>) And the Virgin, consenting to his message, and saying,
&#8220;Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be
it done to me according to thy word,&#8221; immediately, in that very instant, conceived Christ.
Many are of opinion that the Blessed Virgin was only espoused by betrothal, or
<i>per verba de futuro</i>, by which only a promise of marriage takes place. So S. Hilary,
<i>in loc</i>.; S. Basil, <i>Hom. on the Human Generation of Christ</i>; Origen, <i>Hom</i>. I,
<i>on divers passages of the Gospels</i>. But others think, with better reason, that the Virgin was
espoused not merely by betrothal, but by marriage, <i>per verba de pr&aelig;senti</i>—by an actual
nuptial contract. This is proved:—1. Because Joseph is called in the verse following, and in
<a href="#scripture-Matthew:1:16">ver. 16</a>, the husband of Mary. This must mean that he had
married her. 2. Joseph wished to put her away, as being with child, as it is said in the verse
following. He had therefore taken her to him to wife; for no one puts away what he has not. 3.
Because &#8220;betrothed&#8221; (<a href="/Luke:2-lapide#scripture-Luke:2:5">Luke ii. 5</a>) is
interpreted to mean married. Yea, Joseph called her his wife. She was therefore already married, and
introduced into the house of her husband, Joseph, as his wife, that, by this means, Joseph might be
the attesting witness of her virginity, and the guardian and nourisher both of herself and her Child
Jesus. Consider, also, that the Blessed Virgin, as soon as she had received Gabriel’s message, being
now full of the Word, visited Elizabeth, and abode with her three months. From whence it does not
seem that she there celebrated her marriage with Joseph, nor yet after her return to Nazareth, for
there exists no trace of such an event. So that she must have celebrated this marriage before
Gabriel’s message, and the Incarnation of the Word Neither would it have been becoming that an
unmarried virgin should undertake so great a journey into a mountainous country, without a husband,
or companion, or without her guardian sending a maid, or some female relation with her. 4. Because
it was plainly befitting that Christ should be born of a woman who was actually married, in order
that he might not be despised by the Jews as illegitimate, but might be received as a legitimate
son. And this is why Joseph is called Christ’s father. Finally, offspring is the proper fruit of
wedlock. Thus Jerome, Haymo, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Ambrose, Jansenius, Suarez, and others,
<i>passim</i>.<br /><br />
It may be objected—1. That the angel says to Joseph, &#8220;Fear not to take Mary thy wife.&#8221;
Therefore, he had not taken her to wife, but only espoused her by betrothal. I reply—to <i>take</i>,
here means the same thing as to <i>keep</i>, and <i>retain</i>: for the angel calls her
<i>his wife</i>. They were therefore married. The Hebrew verbs often signify not only inchoate, but
continuous action. The meaning, therefore, is—&#8220;Dismiss not, O Joseph, thy wife Mary, but keep
and retain her.&#8221; For nothing is put away save what has been received and possessed.<br /><br />
2. The Virgin is here called <i>betrothed</i>, before they came together, therefore before marriage.
In reply, I deny the consequence. To come together does not here signify to contract marriage, nor
yet to cohabit, but to make use of marriage already contracted.<br /><br />
3. Why is she here spoken of, not as married, but as espoused? I reply, she is called
<i>espoused</i> or <i>betrothed</i>, because her husband had not known her; and therefore she was as
a bride, not yet married to her husband, but only promised. So S. Chrysostom. Hence Peter
Chrysologus (<i>Serm</i>. 175) says, Joseph was a husband in name only, by consent of his spouse;
that is, he was accounted her husband by the bond, not the consummation of marriage.<br /><br />
That there was, however, a real marriage between Joseph and the Blessed Virgin is certain from the
words of the Gospel, and the common agreement of theologians; and the axiom of lawyers,
that—&#8220;Consent, not consummation, validates marriage.&#8221; Whence S. Augustine (lib. 1,
<i>de Nuptiis</i>, c. 11) says—&#8220;The good of marriage was fulfilled in those parents of Christ.
There was offspring, fidelity, a sacrament (for these are the three goods of marriage). We recognize
the offspring, the Lord Jesus Himself; the fidelity, for there was no adultery; the sacrament, for
there was no divorce.&#8221; He teaches the same more at large against Julian the Pelagian (lib. 5),
who denied the marriage of Joseph and Mary. In chap. 9, he maintains that the
<i>jus matrimonii</i> is not repugnant to a vow of chastity. By marriage, I possess a right over my
wife, but because of my vow, I cannot use that right lawfully. If I do use it, I sin against my vow,
not my marriage. That is, I do what is, technically, an irreligious, not an unjust act. For there is
not adultery, as it would be, if the wife were joined in marriage. Joseph, therefore, had by
matrimony, a power over the Blessed Virgin, but by his purpose, and as it would seem by his vow of
chastity, he would not use this power. To have a right or power to do a thing, and to use that
power, are wholly different things. The first is necessary for valid matrimony, but not the
second.<br /><br />
This right of cohabitation, and <i>quasi</i> dominion over a wife, in the case of married virgins,
has several true and real, not fictitious consequences. The first is, that a virgin bride cannot
marry another husband. The second is, that although the vow be broken by cohabitation, it is not
fornication. The third, that offspring divinely granted and born (as Christ in the present instance
was conceived of the Holy Ghost) is accounted legitimate as being born in wedlock.<br /><br />
From all this, it may be gathered that the marriage of the Blessed Virgin Mary with Joseph was not
only real matrimony, but lawful, yea, holy—<i>real</i>, because the essence of wedlock consists in
the mutual delivery of power over each other’s body, even though this power be never exercised. And
a vow of virginity takes away this power and right from no one, but only renders its exercise
unlawful. It is after a similar manner that the
<i>power</i> is separated from the <i>use</i> of a thing, in the case of certain religious, who
remain owners of their paternal inheritance, but who, on account of their vow of poverty, are not
able to make use of it. It was lawful marriage, because, although the Blessed Virgin had made a vow
of virginity, yet she lawfully, and without peril of a breach of her vow, engaged in marriage,
because she knew by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, that Joseph would never use his power and
marital rights to the detriment of her vow. So S. Augustine, <i>de S. Virgin</i>., c. 4, and
theologians, <i>passim</i>. It is, moreover, probable that the Blessed Virgin Mary had revealed
this, her vow, to Joseph before marriage, and that he had consented to it. Some add, that he had
promised to be the guardian of her vow. It was holy marriage, because by means of it Joseph
protected the good repute and the virginity of Blessed Mary; and became the guardian, nourisher, and
educator of the Child Jesus. What were more holy than this?<br /><br />
See S. Thomas, 3 part 29. 2. 1. <i>in corpore</i>, where he assigns many reasons why Christ was born
of an espoused virgin. And he adds that there might be a fifth reason why the Mother of the Lord was
espoused and a virgin, in order that in her person both virginity and matrimony might be honoured
against the heretics, who attack either one or the other. The holy martyr Ignatius, cited by S.
Jerome, gives yet another reason—in order that her child-bearing might be concealed from the devil,
so that he thought that Christ was not born of a virgin, but of a wife.<br /><br />
Observe here, <i>tropologically</i>, in the Blessed Virgin and Joseph the utmost height of angelic
purity and virginity. And thus, the Blessed Virgin has communicated this gift of conjugal chastity
to several eminent persons, specially devoted to her, as to S. Pulcheria, and Martian, to SS. Julian
and Basilissa, to whom, in the first night after their vow of chastity, Christ appeared, accompanied
by a vast throng of men in white robes, on the one hand, and the Blessed Virgin, girt about with a
virgin throng, on the other hand. They who were with Christ chanted forth—&#8220;Thou hast conquered
Julian, thou hast conquered.&#8221; And they who were with the Blessed Virgin replied—&#8220;Blessed
art thou, Basilissa, who hast despised earthly marriage, and prepared thyself for eternal
glory.&#8221; Wherefore Julian was the spiritual ancestor of innumerable believers in Christ and
martyrs, and Basilissa, by word and example, was the mother of innumerable virgins of Christ.<br /><br />
Also S. Henry I., or as some say, II., Emperor of Germany led such a life with his wife Cunegundes,
of whom, when he was dying, he said to her parents—&#8220;Lo! a virgin I received her from you, a
virgin I restore her to you.&#8221; Such, too, were S. C&aelig;cilia, with her spouse Valerian, to
whom the Blessed Virgin sent by the hands of angels crowns of roses and lilies.<br /><br />
<i>Symbolically</i>, in this marriage and family union of Joseph with Mary there was an image of the
Sacred Trinity. For Joseph represented the Eternal Father, the Blessed Virgin the Holy Ghost, both
because she was most holy, and because she had conceived by the Holy Spirit. Christ represented
Himself, even the Son of God. Whence, 1. As there is in the Sacred Trinity an essence of Deity in
Three Persons, so here was there one marriage and one perfect family, consisting of three persons,
namely, Joseph, Mary, and Christ. 2. As in the Holy Trinity the Father spiritually begets the Son,
and breathes the Holy Ghost, so here the Blessed Virgin spiritually—not carnally, but by the power
of the Holy Ghost—conceived and brought forth Christ. 3. In the Holy Trinity, the Father begets the
Son, as light emits light: whence we sing in the Creed, &#8220;Light of Light, very God of very
God;&#8221; so the Blessed Virgin, as the Star of the Sea, brought forth Christ, who is &#8220;the
Brightness of Eternal Light,&#8221; and the &#8220;Mirror without a spot.&#8221; (<a
	href="/Wisdom:7-lapide#scripture-Wisdom:7:25">Wisd. vii. 25.</a>) Whence, like as a star, without any diminution of
itself, sends forth its rays, so did the
Blessed Virgin, without any derogation to herself, bring forth Christ the Light of the world.
&#8220;Neither do the star’s rays diminish its lustre, nor did the Son of the Virgin take away her
maiden purity and integrity,&#8221; says S. Bernard. (<i>Hom</i>. 2 <i>super Missus est</i>) Whence
also those words of Simeon concerning Christ, &#8220;A Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory
of Thy people Israel.&#8221;<br /><br />
This family was then, as it were, a heaven upon earth—a family, not so much of three human persons
as of three embodied angels—yea, symbolically, as it were, of three Divine Persons. Therefore it is
not doubtful that it was thronged with angels, ministering to the Virgin, as Queen of Heaven, and to
Christ, as their Lord and their God. Yea, they were amazed, and had the utmost desire to behold the
Word Incarnate. Therefore, that house, as it were heaven, was concealing an admirable mystery. Black
without, but fair within, &#8220;as the tents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon&#8221; (<a
	href="/Song_of_Songs:1-lapide#scripture-Song_of_Songs:1:5">Cant. i. 5</a>), says Rupert. Whence John Gerson
(<i>Sermon on the Nativity</i>) exclaims in wonder—&#8220;O, how
delectable to the Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, was that house’s Trinity, Christ, Mary,
Joseph. Nothing dearer, nothing better, nothing on earth more excellent. Heaven envied earth such
inhabitants—inhabitants more befitting heaven than earth.&#8221;<br /><br />
<i>Tropologically</i>, Let husbands and wives imitate the Blessed Virgin and Joseph in purity, in
sanctity, in patience, and charity, bearing one another’s burdens. There was in this family of
Joseph, Mary, and Christ, the utmost concord amongst all, the utmost love, the utmost reverence,
humility, piety, help, and mutual compliance. From it, not only all bickering was absent, but even
the very lightest suspicion of any evil thing. Hence such a family deserved to have Christ, the Holy
of Holies, for its offspring. In our day, there are often in families depraved, disobedient, proud,
quarrelsome, impure children, because their parents are such. Like father, like child. What he sees
and hears his father and mother do, that he also imitates and imbibes. Children ever ape their
parents.<br /><br />
<i>Before they came together</i>. Understand this not as though they afterwards came together for
the marital debt, as the impure Helvidius maintained, who denied that the Blessed Virgin was always
a virgin, and asserted that she afterwards became by Joseph the mother of those who, in the Gospel,
are called the Lord’s brethren. S. Jerome confutes him at length, and shows that nothing is meant
here except the miraculous conception of Christ by a pure virgin. Thus we say in common speech,
&#8220;Such a one had grey hairs before he was an old man,&#8221; meaning that it was remarkable
that he was early grey-headed, even though he never became an old man, but died before he came to
old age. Similarly also we say, &#8220;His boy was wise before he came to man’s estate,&#8221;
meaning that he was of precocious intellect, even though he died before he was of mature age; as
those who are precocious do thus often die. Moreover, the brethren of the Lord are called His
kinsmen. For, as S. Jerome says (<i>Cont. Helvid</i>.), brethren are so called in four ways: by
nature, race, relationship, affection. People are brethren by nature, who are born of the same
parents, by race, who belong to the same nation, as S. Paul calls the Jews his brethren (<a href="/Romans:9-lapide">Rom.
	ix.</a>), by kinship, as cousins are called brethren in Scripture, by affection, as when Christians love
one another with mutual fraternal love. For this is the love of the brotherhood, which S. Paul so
often commands.<br /><br />
<i>She was found with child, by the Holy Ghost</i>. Observe that Joseph understood by her
appearance, that his wife, the Blessed Virgin, had conceived. But whether he knew that she was with
child by the Holy Ghost, or not, is doubtful. S. Basil, Origen, Theophylact, and others, hold the
affirmative. But the contrary is more probable, because Joseph wished to put her away, but is
forbidden by the angel, who removes his scruple, adding, &#8220;That which is conceived in her is of
the Holy Ghost.&#8221; Therefore, before the revelation of the angel, he did not know this, because
had he known it, he would not have wished to put her away.<br /><br />
It is said, therefore, that the Blessed Virgin was found with child of the Holy Ghost, because she
had verily conceived by Him. The expression, <i>by the Holy Ghost</i>, must be referred to the words
<i>with child</i>, not to <i>was found</i>. So the rest of the Fathers and Interpreters,
<i>passim</i>. Origen adds that, &#8220;She was found by the angels, for they knew that she had
conceived by the Holy Ghost.&#8221;<br /><br />
<i>Of the Holy Ghost</i>. Not as though Christ were framed of the substance of the Holy Spirit, as
is the case with other offspring, nor of the Holy Ghost as a father; because Christ,
<i>qu&agrave;</i> man, was not like to the Holy Ghost, who in His nature is God; but of the Holy
Ghost as an agent and artificer. Thus S. Ambrose, <i>in Luc</i>. i. 35. <i>Of the Holy Ghost</i>,
not, therefore, as of the Father, but, as it were, supplying the concourse of the father. For the
Holy Ghost supplied the place of a father to Christ, through His power and operation. So S. Ambrose
c. 2, <i>de Spiritu Sancto</i>, c. 5, and S. Augustine, <i>Enchiridion</i>, c. 39. For the substance
of our Lord’s body was supplied by the Blessed Virgin, as His only human parent. Strictly speaking,
<i>by</i> denotes the efficient cause, <i>of</i> the material cause—as we say in the Creed:
&#8220;Conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary.&#8221;<br /><br />
You may ask—why does not Matthew say also, &#8220;With child by the Eternal Father, and by the Son.
as well as by the Holy Ghost?&#8221; It is replied that he might have said this with equal truth.
For it is an axiom among Theologians, that the operations of the Holy Trinity, <i>ad extra</i>—that
is, with reference to the universe of created things—are common to all the Three Divine Persons. But
he preferred to say, &#8220;By the Holy Ghost,&#8221; because, as power is appropriated to the
Father, and wisdom to the Son, so love, goodness, and grace, which especially shine forth in this
work of the Incarnation, are attributed to the Holy Ghost. For the Holy Ghost proceeds from the
Father and the Son by spiration, being, as it were, the term of the ideal love of the Father and the
Son.<br /><br />
Moreover S. Thomas (3 <i>part, qu&aelig;st</i>. 32, <i>art</i>. 1 <i>et seq</i>) teaches that the
words &#8220;by the Holy Ghost&#8221; signify three things: 1. That of the pure love of God and the
Holy Spirit, without any human merits, the Incarnation of the Lord was accomplished. 2. Of the same
Grace of God and the Holy Spirit, without previous merits, He was conceived. Whence S. Augustine, c.
<i>de Pr&aelig;dest. Sanct</i>. c. 15, proposes Christ, as it were, the ideal of election and the
elect. &#8220;Whatsoever man is a Christian, he becomes such from the beginning of his faith by that
self-same grace by which, at the first, Christ was made man: by the same Spirit a Christian is born
again, by whom Christ was born; remission of sins is effected in us by the self-same Spirit by whom
it was brought about that Christ should have no sin.&#8221; 3. Christ was holy, by virtue of his
conception. For, like as a man, who, by ordinary generation, is propagated from Adam, a sinner, is
by virtue of his conception born a sinner, so Christ, who was conceived, and, as it were, propagated
by the Holy Ghost, was conceived holy by virtue of his conception. For that which the Holy Ghost
worketh can be nothing else save warmth and fire. 4. <i>By the Holy Ghost</i>, signifies that He, in
the formation of the Humanity of Christ, transposed all His sanctity into It (so far as a creature’s
capacity would allow of such a thing, and so far as a creature can become like the Creator), and, as
it were, transformed It into Himself: so that, next to Himself, He made It to be a pattern and
prototype of holiness, that from It and according to It He might, as it were, express and depict all
other holiness, both of all angels, and all men. Therefore the humanity of Christ was the most
perfect, special, and most holy work of the Holy Ghost, in which He Himself constituted a fount of
all sanctity, which, by its own purity, might wash away the filth of all sins, and, so far as it is
concerned, sanctify all sinners.<br /><br />
Moreover, S. Thomas (<i>qu&aelig;st</i>. 32, <i>art</i>. 2) teaches that the preposition
&#8220;by,&#8221; in the expression <i>by the Holy Ghost</i>, signifies that Christ is
consubstantial with the Holy Ghost, as touching his Godhead, not as touching his manhood, which He
wrought in Christ. This, however, S. Augustine denies.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Whereupon Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was
	minded to put her away privily<br /><br /> </i>1. S. Chrysostom (<i>in loco</i>), S. Augustine (<i>Epist</i>. 52,
<i>ad Macedon</i>.), Justin M.
(<i>contra Tryphon</i>.), are of opinion, that Joseph suspected evil of the Blessed Virgin, as
though she had conceived by another man. They think that this is hinted at in the expression,
<i>make her a public example</i>. But we say, far be any such suspicions concerning a virgin so
holy, or a man so just. How, indeed, could Joseph have suspected adultery in such a wife, or
uncleanness in her parents’ house?<br /><br />
2. Others think that Joseph wished to put away the Blessed Virgin out of extreme reverence, because
he thought himself unworthy to have to wife one who was with child by the Holy Ghost. Whence they
are also of opinion that S. Joseph accompanied the Blessed Virgin when she visited Elizabeth, and
heard her saluted as Mother of God, and therefore thought himself unworthy of her. This is the
opinion of Origen, S. Basil, Theophylact, S. Bernard (<i>Hom</i>. 2 <i>super Missus est</i>). S.
Brigit asserts that the same was revealed to her (lib. 7, <i>Revelat</i>. c. 25). Whence Salmeron
(lib. 3, c. 30) supports the same opinion by thirteen reasons.<br /><br />
But, 3, plainly and surely, Joseph, seeing the Blessed Virgin with child, was astonished at the
novelty of the thing, and his mind was agitated by contending and fluctuating emotions, and he
reasoned somewhat in this way: &#8220;I know that this Virgin is most holy, wherefore I do not
believe that she has been false to her troth, plighted to me. Still, she is with child, and I know
not by me. But by whom I know not. Can it be by a former husband? Or can she have suffered violence
on her journey, when she went to visit Elizabeth? Can she have suffered illusion from some spirit
during sleep? Or, what would be more consonant with her sanctity, is she with child by an angel, or
by the Deity Himself? Well, however the case may be, I am unwilling to retain her, if an angel, or
God Himself, desires to have her. Wherefore I will resign her, and put her away from me.&#8221;<br /><br />
God permitted this to take place in order that the conception of the Blessed Virgin by the Holy
Ghost might be attested unto all, both by Joseph and by the Angel. Thus God permitted S. Thomas to
doubt concerning Christ’s Resurrection, that he, touching Christ’s very wounds, might bear an
irrefragable testimony to the same Resurrection.<br /><br />
Joseph, who was a righteous man, teaches husbands and believers not to suspect evil concerning just
and holy persons upon slight grounds, but to wait for proofs. They should not be too ready to
<i>infer</i> guilt, but should put the most favourable construction they can upon everything.<br /><br />
You may ask, why did not Joseph interrogate the Blessed Virgin, wherefore, and by whom she was with
child? I reply, that it is merely the first thought which arose in Joseph’s mind, which is referred
to, and which, out of modesty, he kept to himself. And he was shortly afterwards anticipated by the
Angel, who answered in behalf of the Virgin, and exonerated him by saying that she had conceived by
the Holy Ghost.<br /><br />
The Blessed Virgin was unwilling, of her own accord, to make known this divine secret to Joseph, in
order that she might not seem to boast of her own gifts, so wonderful and so divine; but she
confided all to God, and God’s providential care, most certainly trusting that God would defend her
good repute and her innocence, and either in His own time open out the whole matter, as she had seen
that He had lately done in the case of her cousin Elizabeth, or else would order all things to His
own greater glory, and therefore to the greater honour and reverence of this, her conception. From
whence, see here and admire the greatness of soul, and the lofty resignation and confidence of the
Blessed Virgin in God, whereby she put away from her all this peril and fear of dark suspicion and
infamy. And herein she has given a singular example of equanimity and confidence to wives who have
jealous husbands, that they, too, should put their trust in God, that God will make clear their
innocence and chastity, will protect them, and make them a praise, as he did in this case of the
Blessed Virgin. Thus S. Jerome says: &#8220;This is the testimony to Mary’s purity, that Joseph,
knowing her chastity, and wondering at what had happened, hides in silence the mystery of which he
was ignorant.&#8221; And S. Ambrose (<i>in Luc</i>. i.) says: &#8220;The Lord preferred that some
should rather doubt concerning His own generation, than concerning His Mother’s purity.&#8221;<br /><br />
It appears from all this that Joseph did not accompany the Blessed Virgin when she, very shortly
after her Conception of Christ, visited S. Elizabeth. For if he had been in her company, and had
seen and heard the great and wonderful things which befell her, they would have removed all his
scruples, and he would not have thought of putting her away. And especially when S. Elizabeth said
to the Blessed Virgin: &#8220;Whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? He
would have known from thence, that not only had she conceived of God, but that she had conceived God
Himself, and that she was carrying Him in her womb.<br /><br />
Observe that Joseph is here called <i>just</i>—that is, a man of probity—forasmuch as he was one who
wished, out of charity, to consult for the good fame, yea, even for the dignity of his spouse, when
he thinks of putting away privily one whom he thought himself unworthy of. S. Jerome and Theophylact
think that husbands were commanded by the old law to traduce and accuse before the judges their
wives, if they were guilty of adultery. But they adduce no place in which such a precept is given.
For the passage in <a href="/Numbers:5-lapide#scripture-Numbers:5:2">Num. v. 2</a> only permits such
a thing to be done, but does not order it.<br /><br />
<i>To make her a public example</i>. Not, to send her away to her own house, as Abul. thinks. For
the Greek is,
<i>&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#947;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#953;</i>—that is, to
<i>disgrace</i>, to <i>defame</i>, or, as S. Augustine (<i>Epist</i>. 59,
<i>ad Paulinum</i>) says, rendering literally, &#8220;<i>to make an example of</i>.&#8221; It was
the custom in Crete to lead adulteresses through the midst of the streets, as they did captives at
Rome, that they might be gazed at and derided. Whence that ancient punishment by law against bawds:
&#8220;Let bawds and adulterers be caned through the public streets of the city, that they may be
reviled and derided.&#8221; And the line of Propertius: &#8220;Not even if the infamous one should
traverse the whole city.&#8221;<br /><br />
<i>Was minded to put her away privily</i>. By the way of secret divorce, giving her privily a bill
of divorcement, as Abul. says on the passage, <i>qu&aelig;st</i>. 39; or rather, and in a more
honourable way for her, by leaving her on the plea of travel, as going away into a far country. So
Maldonatus. Whence the Syriac translates: &#8220;<i>And he thought of leaving her secretly</i>:&#8221; and the Arabic,
&#8220;<i>Since he did not wish to put her to public shame, he thought upon a private dismissal</i>.&#8221;<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>But while he thought on these things</i>. He had evidently not resolved upon them. For this was
his first thought, and, as it were, the first motive of his mind.
<i>Behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, thou son of David,
	fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy
	Ghost.<br /><br />
	Conceived</i>: that is at one and the same time, <i>conceived</i>, <i>formed</i>, and <i>animated</i>, for this
is the proper meaning of <i>&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#957;</i>—that is,
<i>begotten</i>, <i>born</i>. See Abul., <i>qu&aelig;st</i>. 52, and S. Thomas, 3
<i>part. qu&aelig;st</i>. 33 &amp; 34, where he teaches that the Body of Christ was in the very
instant of its Conception, as regarded all its members, 1, perfectly formed and organized by the
Holy Ghost; 2, animated with a reasonable soul; 3, assumed by the Word. 4. That the soul of Christ
was filled with all wisdom, and the grace of that Headship which flows from thence into all the
members—<i>i.e</i>., to all the faithful. 5. That the same soul saw God through the Beatific Vision.
6. That the same had the use of reason, even apart from the Beatific Vision, by means of infused
knowledge, and that, in this way, It knew that It was hypostatically united to the Word, and
therefore gave God highest thanks because of this vision and exaltation: and that God revealed to
the soul of Christ His own will, concerning His death upon the Cross, that He might thereby redeem
and save mankind; and that the soul of Christ forthwith accepted this, and offered himself to God as
a whole burnt-offering, a victim for sin for the salvation of the world, with the utmost humility,
obedience, reverence, love, exultation, and joyfulness of mind, saying—&#8220;Lo, I come; in the
volume of the book it is written of me, that I should do thy will. Yea, O my God, I am content to do
it: Thy law is written in my heart.&#8221; (<a href="/Psalms:39-lapide#scripture-Psalms:39:8">Ps. xxxix. 8</a>, and <a

<i>She shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins</i>. If
Jesus, as follows from this, is Emmanuel, that is, God with us; if He is the offspring and the Son of Blessed Mary, as
is here said, then she is not only Mother of Christ but Mother of God, as defined by the Council of Ephesus against
Nestorius. For Mother and Son are relative terms. Moreover, Valentinus is condemned by this passage, who taught that
Christ brought down a celestial body from heaven, and passed through the Blessed Virgin as through a conduit-pipe. But
she who bears a son is really the mother of the son; and furnishes, and indeed provides his body and all his
limbs.<br /><br />
<i>Jesus</i>, that is, Saviour. This was Christ’s proper name, here foretold by the Angel, but given Him at
circumcision, a name which signifies and represents His office and dignity—yea, compendiously His whole
life.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet saying, Behold a virgin shall
	be with child, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with
	us. </i>The Syriac is: <i>And they shall call his name Amanuil</i>, which is explained, <i>God with us.</i> The
Persian has, <i>Immanuil</i>, that is, because God dwelleth in us. The Egyptian version—<i>And they shall give him the
	name Emmanuel</i>, the interpretation of which is, <i>for God is with us</i>. S. Matthew to the reader, or, as some
think, the Angel to Joseph, here brings forward the prophecy in <a href="/Isaiah:7-lapide#scripture-Isaiah:7:14">Isa.
	vii. 14</a>, to signify that it was now being fulfilled
in this Conception of the Blessed Virgin, his wife, and would be perfectly fulfilled when she brought forth. And
therefore he called Joseph the son of David, because the same thing was promised by God to David. I have fully expounded
this prophecy in my commentary on Isa. vii., which see.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Behold</i>. A word exacting attention, consideration, and admiration. As it were, &#8220;Behold, O ye angels, and all
mankind, see and admire a new and wonderful thing, a thing unheard of in all ages. For a virgin shall conceive and bring
forth Emmanuel, that is, God made man.&#8221; Whence Jeremiah, overcome with astonishment at the same event, exclaims
(<a href="/Jeremiah:31-lapide#scripture-Jeremiah:31:22">xxxi. 22</a>), &#8220;The Lord hath created a new thing upon the
earth: a woman shall compass a man.&#8221;<br /><br />
Cyrus, the first king of Persia, according to the testimony of Xenophon, never admired, and taught his friends to admire
nothing on earth. For this is the mark of a great and a regal mind, to despise all things as being beneath him, as being
of less importance than himself. And Seneca said that a wise man admired nothing, because, being above the earth, he
despised all things lower than himself. But in Divine matters all things are worthy of admiration; because they are
great, yea, the greatest things, especially the mystery of Emmanuel, because it is the great mystery of Divine
Godliness, as the Apostle says, <a href="/1_Timothy:3-lapide#scripture-1_Timothy:3:10">1 Tim. iii. 10</a>. Therefore,
the goodness of the great God is a thing to be astonished at
and admired. &#8220;Who through the bowels of his mercy visited us, the day-spring from on high.&#8221; &#8220;Behold,
therefore, the infant Word, the wise Child, the God-Man,&#8221; says S. Bernard. Theologians and contemplative writers
teach that we can consider and meditate upon this mystery in various ways, as by the method of compassion, of joy, of
thanksgiving, of love, of imitation, but most loftily by wonder, as though we were always stumbling, amazed and
astounded at this so great condescension of our God, whereby He deigned to descend to us worms of the earth so as to
become a worm with us; and this, not for His own sake, but for ours, that He might unite men as worms to Himself, and
make them gods. Thus the Blessed Virgin was amazed, and thus, too, S. Paul, S. Bernard, and Francis, and other
especially saintly persons, who plainly and entirely despised the world, and all the things which are in the world, as
being petty, brief, and transitory, and fixed their whole love, thought, and amazement on the Word Incarnate, and had
their conversation always with Jesus, despising all other things.<br /><br />
<i>Emmanuel</i>. The Syriac has <i>Amman Elohan</i>—<i>i.e</i>., our God with us; but the word <i>our</i> is not in the
Hebrew Emmanuel. From the Syriac it appears possible that S. Matthew, if he wrote in Syriac (as, many think, because the
Jews for whom he was writing, in the time of Christ spoke in Syriac), interpreted the Hebrew <i>Emmanuel</i> by the
Syriac <i>Emman Eloha</i>, or God with us. Munster, and others who have translated the Gospel of S. Matthew out of Latin
into Hebrew, render the single Hebrew word Emmanuel by two, <i>Immanu Elohim</i>.<br /><br />
Some think that this interpretation was made by the Greek translator, who was followed by the Latin. The French shorten
Emmanuel into Noel, which they duplicate and sing at Christmastide. Now, the name Emmanuel signifies the Incarnation of
the Word, and His whole Economy in the Flesh, because by It He was properly and physically God with us, by means of His
flesh and His conversation, and ethically by reconciliation and grace. So S. Chrysostom.<br /><br />
You may say: How is the name Jesus the same as Emmanuel, as S. Matthew here intimates? Tertullian (<i>lib. contra
	Jud&aelig;os</i>) answers that it is the same in sense if not in sound. For that God should be with us is the same
thing as that a Saviour—<i>i.e</i>., Jesus—should be with us. For none other than God could be our Saviour.<br /><br />
Observe the Hebraism by which <i>called</i> is put for <i>be</i>. <i>He shall be called Emmanuel</i>, that is, <i>He
	shall be Emmanuel</i>. This is by the figure of speech metonymy, to which the following passages are clearly
similar: <a href="/Jeremiah:23-lapide#scripture-Jeremiah:23:6">Jer. xxiii. 6</a>, <a
	href="/Zechariah:8-lapide#scripture-Zechariah:8:3">Zech. viii. 3</a>, and <a
	href="/Isaiah:9-lapide#scripture-Isaiah:9:6">Is. ix. 6</a>—&#8220;And his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, God: the
Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of peace.&#8221; For all these things are signified, either
explicitly or implicitly by the name of Jesus.<br /><br />
Note, also, that Christ is not called by Matthew and Isaiah <i>Emmanu Jehovah</i>, or <i>Emmanu Adonai</i> or
<i>Elohim</i>, though all these are names of God, because Jehovah connotes the essence of God, or signifies God as He is
the first, chief, and uncircumscribable Entity, from whom all other entities derive their existence. <i>Adonai</i>
connotes the dominion of God, and signifies God as He is the Ruler, the Judge, and the Avenger of all things. But
<i>El</i> connotes the might and omnipotence of God, and signifies God as He is strong and omnipotent, because God
manifested His utmost might and power in the Incarnation, and in Christ, for through Christ He hath vanquished His
strongest enemies, even the devils, hell, death, and sin, yea, and all sins and vices, however many and however great.
Whence, also, the Angel who announced this mystery, was called Gabriel—<i>i.e</i>., the <i>strength of
	God</i>.<br /><br />
Hence, also, tropologically, observe: God is with us, not only in essence, presence, and power, as He is in all and
every creature; but by the Incarnation He is also with us truly, properly, and really, as a Brother, living, speaking
with us in the human nature assumed by Him, Therefore—2, He is with us, as a Head with its members. For Christ, as the
Head of the faithful, causes to flow into them spiritual sense and motion, together with direction and government. 3.
The Same, being Incarnate, is with us in the Eucharist, as it were our Food, feeding us with his own Flesh, and giving
us to drink of His own Blood. So far, physically. 4. Christ, ethically, is with the Church as a bridegroom with a bride,
assisting, protecting, sustaining, adorning, making her fruitful. Whence the Psalmist: &#8220;For though I should walk
in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.&#8221; (<a
	href="/Psalms:22-lapide#scripture-Psalms:22:4">Ps. xxii. 4.</a>) Therefore the
believer, in every difficulty, labour, or tribulation, invokes Emmanuel, that is, God with us, conversant in our flesh.
And joyfully he cries, &#8220;The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall lack nothing. He shall lead me in a green pasture, and
lead me forth beside the waters of comfort.&#8221; And, <a href="/Psalms:27-lapide#scripture-Psalms:27:1">Ps. xxvii.
	1</a>, &#8220;The Lord is my light and my salvation,
whom, then, shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? If armies in camp should
stand together against me, my heart shall not fear; if a battle should rise up against me, in this will I be
confident.&#8221; And with Paul, &#8220;If God be for us, who is against us?&#8221; so now, to any believer, but
especially to a saint or a martyr, it is lawful to say what the Angel said to Gideon, &#8220;The Lord is with thee, O
most valiant man.&#8221; (<a href="/Judges:6-lapide#scripture-Judges:6:12">Judges vi. 12.</a>)<br /><br />

<i>And knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son: and he called his name Jesus.<br /><br />
</i>1. S. Hilary, <i>in loc</i>., cited by S. Thomas <i>in Catena</i>, Dionys. Carthus., and Gagneius expound as
follows: As the Jews were not able to look upon and recognize the face of Moses on account of the rays of light which
God had, as it were, breathed into him when He talked with him on Mount Sinai, so neither was Joseph able to look upon
and to know the Blessed Virgin, forasmuch as she had God in her womb, and therefore her face was most radiant. But after
Christ was born, this glory and effulgence left her face, and then she could be seen and known by Joseph.<br /><br />
2. On the contrary S. Epiphanius, <i>H&aelig;resi</i> 30—that is, his treatise against the Ebionites—expounds thus:
Joseph knew her not in mind. He did not discover the sanctity and the dignity of the Blessed Virgin, his wife, until she
brought forth Christ. But these expositions are either incorrect or else symbolical and mystical.<br /><br />
3. According, therefore, to the true literal meaning, to know one’s wife signifies in Scripture the conjugal act. This,
therefore, is excluded with reference to Christ, so as to signify that He was not conceived of Joseph, but by the Holy
Ghost.<br /><br />
<i>Until</i>. From hence the heretics have taken occasion to say that Joseph knew her after she had brought forth her
Son. Whence they deny that the Blessed Virgin always remained a Virgin, and that after bearing her Child she lost her
virginity. Thus Helvidius, Jovinian, the Ebionites, and the rest of the Antidicomariani, who are confuted by S.
Epiphanius, S. Jerome, S. Augustine and others, who teach that the word <i>until</i>, in this place, only signifies what
took place up to the time of the birth, not what happened after the birth, which is not here referred to. For by this
word <i>until</i>, Matthew wished to assert a wonderful thing—a thing hitherto unheard of, and, according to nature,
incredible—even the Conception of Christ, without a father, by a virgin mother. Similarly, <i>until</i> is used, <a
	href="/Psalms:110-lapide#scripture-Psalms:110:1">Ps. cx.
	1.</a>, &#8220;Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool,&#8221; not because Thou shalt not
after
that sit any longer, but because Thou shalt then sit far more gloriously, as victor and triumphant at my right hand. And
in <a href="/Matthew:5-lapide#scripture-Matthew:5:26">Matthew v. 26</a>, &#8220;Thou shalt not go out from thence until
thou shalt pay the last farthing;&#8221; that is, thou
shalt never come out from the fire of hell. And <a href="/2_Samuel:6-lapide#scripture-2_Samuel:6:23">2 Sam. vi. 23</a>,
&#8220;Therefore Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no
child unto the day of her death,&#8221; <i>i.e</i>., never. And, <a href="/Genesis:8-lapide#scripture-Genesis:8:7">Gen.
	viii. 7</a>, concerning the raven, which Noah sent
forth out of the ark: &#8220;Which went forth and did not return until the waters were dried up;&#8221; <i>i.e</i>., it
never returned. Thus, too, we say, &#8220;S. Agnes continued a virgin until death;&#8221; <i>i.e</i>., she always
remained a virgin, for she could not lose her virginity after she was dead.<br /><br />
You may urge, S. Matthew says, <i>until she brought forth her firstborn son</i>; therefore she had other sons, by
Joseph, namely those who in the Gospel are called the Lord’s brethren. I reply by denying the conclusion. For, in
Scripture, any one is called a first-born son, who has no elder brothers, even though he be an only son. This is plain
from <a href="/Exodus:4-lapide#scripture-Exodus:4:22">Exod. iv. 22</a>, and <a
	href="/Exodus:14-lapide#scripture-Exodus:14:2">xiiii 2</a>. The word &#8220;first&#8221; denies the existence of any
previous sons, but does not
require, or presuppose, that there were any subsequent. Thus, an only son is even now called the first-born.<br /><br />
Therefore it is a doctrine of the faith that the Blessed Virgin always remained a virgin, as is plain from <a
	href="/Luke:1-lapide#scripture-Luke:1:34">S. Luke i.
	34</a>, <a href="/Ezekiel:44-lapide#Ezekiel:44:2">Ezek. xliv. 2</a>, and by the universal consent of the Fathers,
and the common consent, and perpetual tradition of the
Church. (See S. Jerome, <i>contra Helvid</i>., init. tom. 2.) <br /><br />
