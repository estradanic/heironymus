The book of the generation.—Thus it is verbally in the Greek, Latin, Syrian, Arabic, Egyptian,
Persian texts. But the Ethiopian has <i>the genealogy of Jesus Christ</i>. Matthew here seems to
imitate Moses. Listen to what blessed Peter Damian says in his Sermon on S. Matthew:
<blockquote>
	As Moses is not improperly placed before the prophets and all who have written anything in the Old
	Testament, so Matthew rightly takes precedence of all who are found to have written in the New
	Testament. For as Moses compiled an account of the origin of the world, so has Matthew described
	the rising newness of the Church, as it were of a spiritual world. Hence it has been provided
	that, the Holy Ghost guiding the pen, both Moses and S. Matthew placed the same commencement to
	their respective works, saying, “The Book of the Generation.”
</blockquote>
So far Damian. Now Moses, in <a href="/Genesis:1:1-lapide">Gen. v. 1</a>, thus begins the account of
the genealogy and race of Adam, the first formed man— <i>The Book of generation of Adam</i>: for
Adam was a type of Christ. For as Adam was the father of the mortal life of all men, so is Christ
the Father of the immortal life of the faithful, as S. Paul teaches,
<a href="/Romans:1:14-lapide">Rom. v. 14</a>, &amp;c., and
<a href="/1_Corinthians:15:47-lapide">1 Cor. xv. 47</a> et seq. The Hebrew is תולדות&nbsp; ספר
<i>sepher toledoth, i.e</i>., the book, or catalogue, and enumeration of the generations of Adam.
For, in the <a href="/Genesis:5:1-lapide">5th of Genesis</a>, many, indeed all the generations are
given by which the human race was propagated from Adam to Noah and the Flood, whence it is probable
that S. Matthew, who alludes to Moses, wrote likewise in Hebrew, in this passage,
<i>sepher toledoth, i.e</i>., the book of the generations, in the plural. The LXX, however, in
<a href="/Genesis:5:1-lapide">Gen. v.</a>, have translated <i>βίβλος γενέσεως</i>,
<i>the Book of the generation</i>, in the singular, because the generation of Adam was one, by which
he, as it were the patriarch of the whole human race, begat Seth, which generation was afterwards
continued by Seth and his posterity, and was propagated as far as Noah. The Greek interpreter of S.
Matthew, and the Latin Vulgate, which was translated from the Greek, here followed the LXX, because
properly there is related the generation of Christ alone, whose origin indeed is derived from
Abraham, through many generations of forefathers, and is brought down to Christ. As, therefore, Adam
was the beginning or origin of the old world, so is Christ of the new and better world, whence he is
called by <a href="/Isaiah:9:6-lapide">Isaiah (ix. 6)</a>, “The Father of the coming age.”
(Vulgate). Hence also Virgil, following the Cumæan Sibyl, sings thus concerning Him, Eclogue iv.:—
<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	Now the last age of Cumæan Verses is come,<br />
	Afresh the great cycle of ages begins;<br />
	Returneth the Virgin, Saturnian Kingdoms return:<br />
	The heavenly Offspring descends from on high:
</blockquote>
and adds:—<br /><br />
<blockquote>
	Dear increase of God, true Offspring of Jove,<br />
	Begin, Boy, by smiles thy Mother to know.
</blockquote>
It is plain that these things were spoken by the Sibyl concerning Christ; but Virgil, either through
ignorance or flattery, has transferred them to Pollio, the son of Asinius Pollio, the Roman
Consul.<br /><br />
Note, 1st, <i>Book</i> here is the same as catalogue, or enumeration, or description, whence the
Syriac translation, כתכא, <i>ketobo, i.e</i>., a description, or writing. For this is the exact
meaning of the Hebrew, <i>sepher</i>, to which the Greek <i>βίβλος</i> and Latin
<i>liber</i> correspond. In a like sense, the paper in which was recorded the putting away of a wife
by her husband was called a <i>Book of divorcement</i>. So the <i>Book of the righteous </i>is the
catalogue in which the names and acts of the righteous are recorded. <i>The Book of Life </i>is the
catalogue of the elect, who are written in the mind of God as in a book. Cicero called a catalogue
of names, <i>a book of names</i>.<br /><br />Note, 2nd, the word <i>generation</i>. First, and most
evidently, it is the same as the race, or genealogy of Christ. Second, the generation of Christ is
the conception and birth of Christ. See <a href="/Matthew:1:18-lapide">ver. 18</a>.
<i>The birth </i>(<i>γέννησις</i>) <i>of Jesus Christ was on this wise</i>. Third, as Maldonatus
observes, “the generation of Christ is the life of Christ.” For Matthew, in the Gospel, relates the
history of the whole course of the life of Christ. Fourth, the Hebrew <i>toledoth</i> properly
signifies generations, many of which intervened between Adam and Christ. The steps in Jacob’s
ladder, above which God stood, represented these generations—those steps, I mean, by which the
angels ascended from earth to heaven. For as this ladder joined, as it were, earth to heaven, and
Jacob to God, so this series of generations united all the patriarchs to Christ, who was made Flesh,
and so united all men to Himself and to God.<br /><br />
<i>Son of David, i.e</i>., descendant of David: for the Hebrews call all male lineal descendants,
sons. The Evangelist places David first, then Abraham: 1st, because David was the nearer to Christ,
and through him Christ reaches to Abraham; 2nd, because thus, in a more compendious manner, without
repetition, Christ’s genealogy is stated. He wished to impress this fact, that Christ was descended
from Abraham through David. So S. Jerome. 3rd, and chiefly, because the promise of God made to David
concerning Christ, as about to be born of his posterity, was the later, more special, and more
glorious promise, as S. Chrysostom, Theophilus, Euthym., teach. Hence the Jews constantly call their
Messiah the Son of David. Hence on Palm Sunday, when Christ entered into Jerusalem, they hailed Him
as Messiah: <i>Hosanna to the Son of David, i.e</i>., O Lord, save our Messiah, speaking of Him as
David’s son and heir. Lastly, by the title, <i>Son of David</i>, the nobility of the race from
whence Messiah sprung is hinted at, as also His kingdom, viz., that He too should be a king, as
being the Son of David, a king, according to that divine voice of the Archangel Gabriel to the
Blessed Virgin, “He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God
shall give unto him the throne of David his father: and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for
ever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.” (S. Luke i. 31.) For this reason the prophets
everywhere speak of Christ as David’s son and heir, thus <a href="/Isaiah:9:7-lapide">Is. ix. 7</a>,
<a href="/Leviticus:3:1-lapide">lv. 3</a>; <a href="/Jeremiah:25:5-lapide">Jer. xxv. 5</a>;
<a href="/Ezra:34:23-lapide">Ez. xxxiv. 23</a>, <a href="/Ezra:37:25-lapide">xxxvii. 25</a>,
&amp;c.<br /><br />The first promise which was made to David concerning Christ, that He should
spring from him, and reign for ever, is found <a href="/2_Samuel:7:12-lapide">2 Sam. vii. 12</a>; the
same was confirmed, <a href="/Psalms:88:1-lapide">Ps. lxxxviii</a>. and
<a href="/Psalms:131:1-lapide">cxxxi.</a>; and repeated to Solomon, David’s Son,
<a href="/1_Kings:9:5-lapide">1 Kings ix. 5</a>. When, therefore, S. Matthew says,
<i>Jesus Christ the Son of David</i>, he means that all these promises were now fulfilled in Christ.
Thus S. Chrysostom 2; Theophilus, Euthym.; Irenæus, lib. 8, c. 8; S. Ambrose, lib. 3 <i>in Luc</i>.,
c. 3; and others.<br /><br />
<i>Son of Abraham</i>. The word Son here may be referred either to David or to Christ. For David, as
well as Christ, was a son, <i>i.e</i>. a descendant, of Abraham. It signifies, therefore, that
Christ, through David His father, was also the Son of Abraham, who was the father of them that
believe, and of the ancient Church. The first express promise concerning Christ was made to him.
(Gen. xxii. 18.) Now, from the birth of Abraham to the birth of Christ there were 2,000 years; from
the death of David to Christ, 1,013 years. So great was the antiquity of the oracles and promises of
God concerning Christ; so constant and sure was God’s faithfulness in fulfilling them. And this is
why S. Matthew so carefully derives the genealogy of Christ from Abraham, even through forty-two
generations, in order that he might show the Jews that Jesus Christ was the true Messiah promised to
Abraham, and that He was the Son of Abraham and the rest of the patriarchs; and that He might
therefore, as such, be received, cherished, and worshipped by the Jews.<br /><br />

<i>Abraham begat Isaac</i>. These two, with those who came after them, were the first patriarchs,
the founders of the synagogue and people of God, and of the Kingdom of Christ. They, as types,
foreshadowed Him. (See comment on Genesis, where I have unfolded their genealogies.) I will not here
repeat what has been said. God constantly calls Himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and
even makes a boast, so to say, of this title. Wherefore He chose the posterity of Abraham,
descending through Isaac and Jacob, for His own family and Church, and gave them the sign and pledge
of circumcision. Wherefore God changed Abraham’s name from Abram, <i>i.e</i>., a high father, to
Abraham, that is to say, אב רב המזן, <i>ab rab hamon</i>, or the father of a great multitude—viz.,
of the believing people that should be born of him according to the flesh; in like manner as of
Christ, both Jews and Gentiles, who believe in Him, are born according to the Spirit. Now
Isaac—<i>i.e</i>. laughter—about to be offered up by his father on Mount Moriah, clearly represented
Christ, who was crucified on the same mount, and brought salvation and joy to the whole world.<br /> <br />
<!---->
<i>And Judah begat Pharez and Zara of Thamar</i>. (See what I have said on Tamar, <a href="/Genesis:38:29-lapide">Gen.
	xxxviii. 29.</a>)<br /><br />
Observe that in the genealogy of Christ, with the exception of His Blessed Mother, only four females are made mention
of, three of them harlots—Thamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba—and the fourth a Gentile, Ruth the Moabitess. Rahab, too, was
a Gentile, being an inhabitant of Jericho. If the reason of all this be asked, SS. Jerome, Chrysostom, Ambrose
answer, that it was so because Christ would signify that “He who came for the abolishing and putting away of sins
wished to be born of sinners.” This reason is true, but allegorical. The literal and simple reason is, that these
women were united to their husbands, not in the ordinary way, but after a new and extraordinary manner; and so they
became types of the Church of Christ, which, when the Jews were rejected, was gathered out of the Gentiles by a new
vocation, and after a new manner. Tamar, because Shelah was denied her in marriage, or rather because her union with
him was deferred, using deceit, prostituted herself to Judah. Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, was united to David,
first by adultery, then in marriage. Rahab married Salmon because she hospitably received and protected the Hebrew
spies who were sent by Joshua to Jericho, and so she became of the same faith and religion. Ruth married Boaz when
she had passed with her mother-in-law, Naomi, from Moab into Judæa.<br /><br />
The tropological sense is to show us the vanity of pride of birth, and that true nobility consists, not in ancestry,
but in our own good disposition and virtues. Thus S. Chrysostom. Wherefore let no one be ashamed of his birth, nor
even of vile and wicked ancestors; but let us say with Cicero, “I have outshone my forefathers in virtue.” There can
be no doubt that there are in the ancestry of the most exalted persons, forasmuch as they are sprung from Adam, many
ignoble, worthless, wicked, and infamous persons. Plato, according to Seneca (<i>Epis</i>. 44), is of opinion that
all kings are descended from servants, and that all servants are sprung from kings; that there is no king who has
been entirely free from the plough, and no ploughman who has not been mixed up with kings.<br /><br />
Lastly, Solomon, amongst the other vanities and uncertainties of the world, reckons this: “Because out of prison and
chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a kingdom: and another born king is consumed with poverty.” (<a
	href="/Ecclesiastes:4:14">Eccles. iv. 14.</a>)
<br /><br />

<i>Aminadab</i>. He was prince of the tribe of Judah when the Israelites came out of Egypt, who, when the rest stood
still, fearing to go into the Red Sea, although God had made dry ground through the midst of it, courageously entered
into it, and brought his own tribe safely through, and then the other princes and tribes followed. This is a Hebrew
tradition. To this alludes the verse, <a href="/SongOfSongs:6:12">Cant. vi. 12</a>, “My soul made me like the chariots
of Aminadab.” His son Naasson
succeeded him in the headship of the tribe.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Jesse</i>, or, according to a different punctuation of the Hebrew, <i>Isai</i>. The name itself prefigured Jesus
Christ, who was to be born of him. For Jesse and Jesus are the same word if we consider the root of both, which is to be
found in the Hebrew ישצ <i>iasca, i.e</i>., to save.<br /><br />
<!---->
<i>Of her which had been the wife of Urias</i>. After Uriah’s death, David married his wife, and of her he begat
Solomon, for Solomon was not born of adultery, but in wedlock. In this passage it is intimated that God did not recall
the promises which He had made to David on account of his adultery with Bathsheba, but, on their repentance, He
confirmed His promises. Whence from Bathsheba and her son Solomon Christ was descended. In truth, Bathsheba herself
became a saintly penitent, and brought up Solomon her son in a holy manner. Yea, she became illustrious for the spirit
of prophecy, as I have shown in <a href="/Proverbs:31:1">Prov. xxxi. 1</a>, on the words, “The words of king Lemuel. The
vision which his mother
taught him.” (Vulgate.)<br /><br />
<!---->
<!---->
<i>Now Joram begat Ozias</i>—not directly, but with three generations intervening; for Joram was really the father of
Ahaziah, Ahaziah of Joash, Joash of Amaziah, Amaziah of Azariah or Uzziah, for he had both names. (See <a
	href="/1_Chronicles:3:12">1 Chron. iii. 12</a>,
&amp;c.)<br /><br />
It is asked why S. Matthew here omits these three links in the genealogy. S. Jerome answers, because the Evangelist
wished to form three exact series of fourteen generations each, on which see <a href="#commentary-Matthew:1:17">ver.
	17.</a> And because Jehoram had allied himself to the most wicked Jezebel and to Ahab, in taking Ahab’s sister, the
impious Athaliah, to wife; for God had sworn that, on account of Ahab’s impiety and idolatry, He would blot out all his
posterity. (<a href="/1_Kings:21:21">1 Kings xxi. 21</a>, &amp;c.) Posterity in Scripture is reckoned to the fourth
generation. Here, then, it is
blotted out, forasmuch as it is omitted and obliterated by S. Matthew. Thus S. Hilary, S. Thomas, Jansen, &amp;c. Gaspar
Sanchez gives another reason. He conjectures that Matthew actually wrote as follows: “Joram begat Ochoziah, Ochoziah
begat Joash, Joash begat Amaziah, Amaziah begat Oziah;” but that the copyist, misled by the similarity between Ochoziah
and Oziah, as the names are written in Greek, by a slip of his eye passed over from Ahaziah to Uzziah. Thus Gaspar. But
this would be an enormous blunder, and though one copyist might fall into such an error, it was scarcely possible that
all could. All extant MSS. and Versions are alike here—Greek, Syriac, Latin, Arabic, &amp;c. “<i>Joram begat Ozias</i>,”
not <i>Ahaziah</i>. Besides, if these three generations were inserted, they would make seventeen generations, whereas S.
Matthew says expressly there were fourteen generations.
